Dean P. Foster studied AI at Rutgers and Statistics at the University
of Maryland—before those fields merged into what we now call Machine
Learning. He spent time as a professor at the University of Chicago
and later at the University of Pennsylvania. In 2015, he made the leap
from academia to industry, joining Amazon in New York City, where he’s
been ever since. His current research focuses on machine learning,
reinforcement learning, and large language models (LLMs).

Dean helped pioneer two major areas in game theory: stochastic
evolutionary game dynamics and calibrated learning. In both, he
developed the theoretical tools needed to prove convergence to
equilibrium. The calibrated learning strategies he introduced stemmed
from his early work on individual sequences—work that has since become
foundational in theoretical machine learning. His calibration and
no-internal-regret algorithms were among the first learning methods
proven to converge to a correlated equilibrium.

In statistics, he’s best known for his work on large-scale regression
problems. His early research on risk inflation was one of the first to
seriously consider models with thousands—or even millions—of potential
variables. More recently, his work on alpha-investing offers both a
theoretical foundation for variable selection and a practical
algorithm that’s fast enough to keep pace with streaming data.

At Amazon, Dean founded a reinforcement learning team in New York
City. The group is responsible for figuring out how much of each of
Amazon’s 30 million products to purchase each year—a $300 billion
decision-making problem. Once those purchases are made, the team’s
work continues: routing inventory across hundreds of warehouses so
that products can reach customers quickly. This entire pipeline is
guided by a multi-agent reinforcement learning system.

These days, Dean is especially interested in how LLMs can be used not
just to write code, but to prove theorems about code—a step toward
systems that can reason about software as well as generate it.
