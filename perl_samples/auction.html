<h2>Internet explorer warning</h2>
It appears that internet explorer doesn't work well with this site
(Since it sends a silly file name along with the file.)  I swear, I
didn't write intentionally it to bomb on internet explorer!  So using
firefox should work in the short term.  Hopefully I can fix this
quickly.

<h2>Prep'ing your data</h2>

Here are guidelines for preparing your data:
<ul>
<li> Only .csv files can be used.
 <ul>
<li> csv means commas not tabs!
<li> Look at one of the sample files to
see what it should look like.
<li> If you have interesting strings, you must quote them (I.e. quote
things like "Allston-Brighton".  Spaces and letters are fine, but many
other fancy symbols need quotes.)
<li> Things that you must quote: "Foster, Dean", "Allston-Brighton",
"The Bible starts, \"In the beginning...\" ", etc
</ul>
<li> You have to have names of variables in the first row.
<li> The "Y" variable should come before the X's.
<li> Don't include any X's that you don't want used in the regression!
<li> If you want to fit the entire data set then use the order: Y,
X1, X2, ...
<br><br>
Y, X1, X2
<br>
10, 2, 3
<br>
20, 4, 5
<br>
...
<br><br>
</ul>
To do cross validation:

<ul>
<li> Put the indicator of which obserations are in sample in the first
column (use values in / out)
<li> Variable order: CROSS, Y, X1, X2, X3, ...
<li> Example:
<br><br>
CROSS ,Y ,X1 ,X2
<br>
in, 10, 2, 3
<br>
in, 20, 4, 5
<br>
out, , 5, 4
<br>
out, , 10, 3
<br><br>
<li> You can include values for the Y's that are out of sample--they
will be ignored.
<li> The system will make predictions for the out-of-sample Y's.
</ul>

<h2>The sample data sets</h2>
The bankruptcy data is discussed in our JASA paper.
<p>
The baseball data is from <a
href=""http://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~boos/var.select/baseball.html">here</a>.
It has no particular significance, except I was discussing it in class
when I wrote this page.
<p>
The Hadamard data set (simulated) is motivated by Manfred's paper, <a
href="http://www.cse.ucsc.edu/~manfred/pubs/span.pdf">Leaving the
span</a>.  He argues that linear methods can't find the fit here.  So
if our code find it, we must be non-linear!  (We search the space of
linear models, but our method is clearly non-linear.)
<h2>Code</h2>
If you want the code, please <a
href="mailto:stine@wharton.upenn.edu?subject=Auction code&body=Please send me
the latest version of the auction code (build_model.tgz).  &cc=dean@foster.net">
email</a> either Bob or <a
href="mailto:dean@foster.net">Dean</a>.  We will try to keep a <a
href="build_model.tgz">.tgz</a> file on line and upto date, but it is
best to email for a fresh copy.




<h2> What happens:</h2>
<ul>
<li> This page grabs the file
<li> Then a perl script reads the file and passes it to the C++ code
(that runs in background)
<li> All output for this run is saved in a unique directory under <a
href="./tmp">this</a> directory.
