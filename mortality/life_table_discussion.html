<h1>Life tables</h1>

<p>
The basic data for our calculations comes as a table of death rates.

Notice the death rate for 10 year old females is only 1 in 10,000.  So
if you could stay a 10 year old girl, you would live till about 10,000
years of age!  (Unfortunately, your 10 year old boy friend would
pre-decease you by a few thousand years.)
<p>
The following are standard definitions used in this field:
<PRE>
Let
q(x) = probability that a person will die within one year of age x 
<p>

l(x) = fraction of those still alive at age x
l(0) = 1			everyone alive at age 0		
l(x) = l(x-1) (1-q(x-1))        number alive at x is number at x-1
				times (1 - probability) of death

d(x) = l(x) q(x)		number of deaths in year x

L(x) = number of lives lived between year x and x+1
L(x) = l(x) - d(x)/2		people who die live on average a half year	

e(x) = life expectancy for a person of age x
e(x) = Sum_{i=x,inf} L(i)  / l(x)
</PRE>
<p>
The above defintions should help you understand the <a
