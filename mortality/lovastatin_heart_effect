<p>   
<p>   <img src="http://graphics.nytimes.com/images/a.gif" align=left alt=A> new study  provides the first evidence that people with average cholesterol levels can substantially reduce their risk of heart attack  by 
taking a drug that drives their cholesterol levels even lower.

<p> The study, financed  by Merck & 
Company, involved 6,605 middle-aged-to-elderly men and women, half 
of whom  took Merck's powerful and 
expensive cholesterol-lowering drug, 
lovastatin; the rest took a dummy 
pill. After five years, those who had 
taken  lovastatin had had 37 percent 
fewer heart attacks and other serious signs of heart disease than those 
who had taken  the placebo.

<p> Medical experts said that the 
study had been well conducted and 
that its results were solid. Dr. Claude 
Lenfant, director of the National 
Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, described it as "a great study."

<p> But already the results are opening a debate among medical experts: How hard should people try to 
reduce their cholesterol levels below 
what is now considered acceptable? 
And how much should the nation pay 
to save a few more people from heart 
disease?

<p> In their paper, being published today in The Journal of the American 
Medical Association, the authors 
said that if the study's findings were 
put into practice, the  population eligible for cholesterol-lowering drugs 
would triple, to six million adult 
Americans from the two million who 
qualify for drug treatment today.   
<p>An 
editorial accompanying the paper 
said the annual cost of the drug for 
just 1,000 patients  would be $1,420,500 
-- an average of more than $1,400 -- 
 not including the costs of doctor visits and laboratory tests.

<p>  Many doctors themselves, who 
heard the study results when they 
were reported at a meeting of the 
American Heart Association in November, have already begun taking 
lovastatin or another of the newest 
group of cholesterol-lowering drugs, 
 called statins. One who is not on 
statins  said  he used to ask his doctor 
friends if they were taking one.   
<p>Now, 
he said, the more usual  question is, 
Which statin are you taking?

<p>             Medical experts said that  doctors' 
prescribing patterns were hard to 
know  but  that at least some doctors 
appeared to be prescribing statins 
for people with average cholesterol 
levels. Dr. Jeffrey Isner,  chief of 
vascular medicine and cardiovascular research at St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Boston, a referral specialist 
who speaks to cardiolgists daily, said 
that "some doctors are being very 
aggressive" about prescribing the 
drugs and have told him so.

<p>    A lead author of the paper, Dr. 
Antonio M. Gotto Jr., dean of the 
Weill Medical College of Cornell University,  said he hoped that the study 
would  "redefine what we consider 
normal" in cholesterol levels.   
<p>Until 
now, Dr. Gotto said, no one gave 
 statins to patients  like those in the 
study because medical experts 
"thought it probably wouldn't do any 
good." The study, he said, shows  that 
this perception is not correct.

<p>  Dr. Gotto added that Merck's patent on lovastatin, the first of the 
statins to be approved for marketing, 
was  due to expire  in 2001, which 
should lower its cost.

<p> But some, like Dr. Alan Garber, 
director of the Center for Primary 
Care and Outcomes Research at 
Stanford University, are uneasy with 
prescribing statins for so many people at relatively low risk of heart 
disease.

<p>  Yes, Dr. Garber said, the drugs 
seem safe in short-term studies. And 
yes, some studies with  groups at 
very high risk of heart disease have 
found that statins can prevent death. 
But, he said, there is no information 
on whether there are long-term side 
effects. For people with high cholesterol levels, the drugs' benefits  outweigh  uncertainty about  complications that may occur many years 
later, he said. But, he said, that may 
not be true for people with average 
cholesterol levels.

<p>     Current guidelines for cholesterol 
lowering, determined by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, 
use cholesterol levels, age, sex and 
the presence or absence of other 
factors like high blood pressure and 
cigarette smoking to determine who 
should take a cholesterol-lowering 
drug. Although most of the  participants in this study had one or more 
risk factors for heart disease other 
than cholesterol levels, most did not 
have  cholesterol levels high enough 
to warrant medical treatment under 
those guidelines.

<p>   The participants were 5,608 men 
from 45 to 73 years old, and 997 
women from  55 to 78, who had no 
signs or history of heart disease. 
Their average cholesterol level was 
221 milligrams per deciliter of blood, 
which put them smack in the middle 
of the American cholesterol range, in 
the 51st percentile, the researchers 
reported.

<p>  But their levels of high density 
lipoproteins, or H.D.L.'s, the cholesterol carriers that protect against 
heart disease, were low. The men's 
average H.D.L. levels were  36 milligrams per deciliter of blood, placing 
them in the 25th percentile of all 
American men. The average H.D.L. 
 level for the women was 40, placing 
them in the 16th percentile of American women.

<p>   In addition to taking lovastatin or 
a dummy pill, the  participants were 
asked to eat  a low-fat diet.

<p> After five years, 183 people taking 
the dummy pill had had a heart 
attack or other serious symptom of 
heart disease. But just 116 of those 
taking lovastatin, or 37 percent fewer, had had such a  symptom. 

<p> The lovastatin effect began appearing in the first year of the study, 
Dr. Gotto said, and  held up.

<p> Dr. Gotto added that the drug was 
so effective that it essentially wiped 
out the adverse effect of  a  risk 
factor for heart disease. For example, if people in the study smoked 
cigarettes and took lovastatin, their 
risk became that of someone with the 
same cholesterol level who did not 
take the drug and did not smoke.

<p> The study was not designed to look 
for differences in mortality rates, 
and so it remains possible that even 
if statins reduce   heart attacks in 
people with average cholesterol levels, they may not save lives.

<p> Dr.   Lenfant, director of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, 
praised the research and said that if 
he had a cholesterol level in the 
range of those of the people in the 
study and had even one other  factor 
that increased his chances of developing heart disease --  like cigarette 
smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes or a family history of heart disease --  he  would take a statin.

<p>    But in an editorial accompanying 
the paper, Dr. Thomas A. Pearson, 
 chairman of the department of community medicine at the University of 
Rochester School of Medicine, asked 
a  thorny question:  How much is this 
benefit worth?

<p>  Dr. Pearson said in an interview 
that since there seemed to be so 
many who could potentially benefit 
from statins, "some of my more exuberant colleagues are talking of 
putting this in the water supply." 
Facetiousness aside, he added, the 
drugs cost a great deal -- $900 to 
$1,800 a year for each patient, depending on the dose -- and many 
must take them in order for a few to 
realize the actual  benefit.

<p> Dr. Pearson noted that if 1,000 
people like those in the study took 
lovastatin for five years, 12 heart 
attacks would be prevented, as would 
7 cases of unstable angina,  a type of 
chest pain that indicates severe 
heart disease. In addition, 17 medical 
procedures  to open blocked blood 
vessels would be avoided.

<p> Dr. Scott Grundy,  director of the 
Center for Human Nutrition at the 
University of Texas Southwestern 
Medical School in Dallas, who  is a 
spokesman for the American Heart 
Association, asked who should pay 
for the drugs, especially since many 
people with an average cholesterol 
level can  lower  it by eating a low-fat 
diet, exercising and losing weight.

<p>  "If you're going to increase my 
health insurance because my next-door neighbor has borderline high 
cholesterol," Dr. Grundy said, "and 
if he's sitting around and watching 
TV and eating and getting fat, do you 
want me to pay for that?" 

<p>  Many insurers would pay for statins if doctors prescribed them for 
patients with average cholesterol 
levels, several experts said. The reason, explained Dr. Brian Strom, 
chairman of the department of epidemiology and biostatistics at the 
University of Pennsylvania, is that 
insurers rarely know the laboratory 
 results that correspond to drug prescriptions. They will know that a 
blood test  has been ordered and that 
a cholesterol drug has been prescribed,  "but they don't know the 
actual results" of the test, Dr. Strom 
said.   
<p>On the other hand,  he added, 
insurers "may change the rules in 
response to this." 

<p> Already Dr. Garber of Stanford  is 
seeing the momentum for statins 
build. 

<p> "I was at a meeting of cardiologists and venture capitalists," he 
 said. "One asked, 'How many are 
taking statins?' About half raised 
their hands. A good fraction of them 
had normal cholesterol levels but 
decided this was a good thing to do."

<p>  And so, Dr. Garber said, "the pressure is definitely on to use these 
things." As a result, he said,  "the 
public will be clamoring for them 
too."

<p> But, he  said, "men and women 
should ask, Is this the best possible 
way for me to prevent heart disease?"  For example, he  said, taking 
an aspirin every other day also substantially reduces the risk of heart 
attack  -- although it does not reduce 
cholesterol levels --  and at a cost of 
pennies a day.

<p> "One thing is certain" about statins, Dr. Garber said.   
<p>"This is a very 
expensive way to prevent heart disease."
