<H3> THE FOLLOWNG IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION </H3>

<H3> I'ld walk a mile for a camel </H3>
The detailed numbers and calculations we used are given below.  It is easiest to comprehend
many of the health risks by converting them to a common basis:  the number of miles you would
need to walk a day to overcome the health risk.  The following table relates distance walked
to changes in life expectancy:
<P>
<! ____________________________________________________________>
<hr>
Assume people walk a mile in 20 minutes, and that each minute
exercised gives two minutes increase in life expectancy.
So: <br>
1 mile = 40 minutes                       <br>
1 foot = 0.00757 minutes = 0.4545 seconds <br>
132 feet = 1 minute                       <br>
2.2 feet = 1 second                       <br>
1.5 miles = 1 hour                        <br>
36 miles = 1 day                          <br>
252 miles = 1 week                        <br>
13,000 miles = 1 year                     <br>

<H3> Here are the detailed numbers </H3>
Current age (years):                    <br>
Sex: to make up for being male: 2,700 days = 100,000 miles = 3.5 miles/day  
Too bad for us males!                  <br>
Race (white?):                    <br>
Income (dollars per year):                    <br>
Married female: to make up for being married: 900 days = 30,000 miles = 2 mile/day while you are married   <br>
Married male: to make up for being unmarried: 1,800 days = 60,000 miles = 4 mile/day while you would have been married                     <br>
Smoking: one cigarette = 12 minutes = 1/3 mile                    <br>
Driving (miles per day):                    <br>
<ul>
<li> 1 in 100 people die in car crashes (50,000/year out of a
	population of 250,000,000 times 50 years life)
	so drivers live 1/2 year shorter (1/100 chance of losing 50 years)
		= 6,000 miles walked over life = 1/4 mile/day           <br>
<li>	if one drives 10,000 miles/year = 30 miles/day
	each mile driven requires 1/120 mile = 50 feet walked                    <br>
<li>    note: if you park a block and a half from your work, and hence walk
          three blocks a day, that balances the risk of driving!                    <br>
<li>  Wear seat belt? cuts risk of death in half -> 25 feet walked/mile driven                    <br>
</ul>
Motorcycle?                    <br>
Bicycle?                    <br>
	use street with bike lane: risk of being hit is 1/6 that of no lane                    <br>
	Wear helmet?                    <br>
        See <a href="http://www.emory.edu/WHI/HRC/hrc.html"> the Helmet Resource Center </a>   <br>
Sexual preference (M/F)                    <br>
Number of unprotected sexual acts per month                    <br>
<ul>
  <li> heterosexual
  <li> homosexual
</ul>
living in the city vs. the suburbs (risk of being shot)                    <br>
	- compare that to danger of commuting
	divide by income or race
Weight (pounds):                    <br>
Height (inches):                      <br>
Fat consumption (% of calories):                    <br>
Fruits and vegetables (servings per day):                    <br>
Keep a handgun in the house:                    <br>
Flying - commercial airline (miles per year):                    <br>
Flying - hobby (miles per year):                    <br>
Hang gliding (flights per year):                    <br>

DISCLAIMER:  Of course, the additive model used here is not correct.
But it is a good first approximation; regardless of how many miles
a day you walk, you should quit smoking!
