<h2>11 steps to a better brain</h2>
        
            <p>It doesn't matter how
brainy you are or how much education you've had - you can still improve
and expand your mind. Boosting your mental faculties doesn't have to
mean studying hard or becoming a reclusive book worm. There are lots of
tricks, techniques and habits, as well as changes to your lifestyle,
diet and behaviour that can help you flex your grey matter and get the
best out of your brain cells. And here are 11 of them.</p>
        
        
	
        
            <h5>Smart drugs</h5>
        
        
            <p>AROUND
the age of 40, honest folks may already admit to noticing changes in
their mental abilities. This is the beginning of a gradual decline that
in all too many of us will culminate in full-blown dementia. If it were
possible somehow to reverse it, slow it or mask it, wouldn't you?</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>A
few drugs that might do the job, known as "cognitive enhancement", are
already on the market, and a few dozen others are on the way. Perhaps
the best-known is modafinil. Licensed to treat narcolepsy, the
condition that causes people to suddenly fall asleep, it has notable
effects in healthy people too. Modafinil can keep a person awake and
alert for 90 hours straight, with none of the jitteriness and bad
concentration that amphetamines or even coffee seem to produce.</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>In
fact, with the help of modafinil, sleep-deprived people can perform
even better than their well-rested, unmedicated selves. The forfeited
rest doesn't even need to be made good. Military research is finding
that people can stay awake for 40 hours, sleep the normal 8 hours, and
then pull a few more all-nighters with no ill effects. It's an open
secret that many, perhaps most, prescriptions for modafinil are written
not for people who suffer from narcolepsy, but for those who simply
want to stay awake. Similarly, many people are using Ritalin not
because they suffer from attention deficit or any other disorder, but
because they want superior concentration during exams or heavy-duty
negotiations.</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>The
pharmaceutical pipeline is clogged with promising compounds - drugs
that act on the nicotinic receptors that smokers have long exploited,
drugs that work on the cannabinoid system to block pot-smoking-type
effects. Some drugs have also been specially designed to augment
memory. Many of these look genuinely plausible: they seem to work, and
without any major side effects.</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>So
why aren't we all on cognitive enhancers already? "We need to be
careful what we wish for," says Daniele Piomelli at the University of
California at Irvine. He is studying the body's cannabinoid system with
a view to making memories less emotionally charged in people suffering
from post-traumatic stress disorder. Tinkering with memory may have
unwanted effects, he warns. "Ultimately we may end up remembering
things we don't want to."</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>Gary
Lynch, also at UC Irvine, voices a similar concern. He is the inventor
of ampakines, a class of drugs that changes the rules about how a
memory is encoded and how strong a memory trace is - the essence of
learning (see <i>New Scientist</i>, 14 May, p 6). But maybe the rules
have already been optimised by evolution, he suggests. What looks to be
an improvement could have hidden downsides.</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>Still,
the opportunity may be too tempting to pass up. The drug acts only in
the brain, claims Lynch. It has a short half-life of hours. Ampakines
have been shown to restore function to severely sleep-deprived monkeys
that would otherwise perform poorly. Preliminary studies in humans are
just as exciting. You could make an elderly person perform like a much
younger person, he says. And who doesn't wish for that?</p>
        
        
	
        
            <h5>Food for thought</h5>
        
        
            <p>YOUR
brain is the greediest organ in your body, with some quite specific
dietary requirements. So it is hardly surprising that what you eat can
affect how you think. If you believe the dietary supplement industry,
you could become the next Einstein just by popping the right
combination of pills. Look closer, however, and it isn't that simple.
The savvy consumer should take talk of brain-boosting diets with a
pinch of low-sodium salt. But if it is possible to eat your way to
genius, it must surely be worth a try.</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>First,
go to the top of the class by eating breakfast. The brain is best
fuelled by a steady supply of glucose, and many studies have shown that
skipping breakfast reduces people's performance at school and at work.</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>But
it isn't simply a matter of getting some calories down. According to
research published in 2003, kids breakfasting on fizzy drinks and
sugary snacks performed at the level of an average 70-year-old in tests
of memory and attention. Beans on toast is a far better combination, as
Barbara Stewart from the University of Ulster, UK, discovered. Toast
alone boosted children's scores on a variety of cognitive tests, but
when the tests got tougher, the breakfast with the high-protein beans
worked best. Beans are also a good source of fibre, and other research
has shown a link between a high-fibre diet and improved cognition. If
you can't stomach beans before midday, wholemeal toast with Marmite
makes a great alternative. The yeast extract is packed with B vitamins,
whose brain-boosting powers have been demonstrated in many studies.</p>
        
        
	
        
            <p>A
smart choice for lunch is omelette and salad. Eggs are rich in choline,
which your body uses to produce the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.
Researchers at Boston University found that when healthy young adults
were given the drug scopolamine, which blocks acetylcholine receptors
in the brain, it significantly reduced their ability to remember word
pairs. Low levels of acetylcholine are also associated with Alzheimer's
disease, and some studies suggest that boosting dietary intake may slow
age-related memory loss.</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>A
salad packed full of antioxidants, including beta-carotene and vitamins
C and E, should also help keep an ageing brain in tip-top condition by
helping to mop up damaging free radicals. Dwight Tapp and colleagues
from the University of California at Irvine found that a diet high in
antioxidants improved the cognitive skills of 39 ageing beagles -
proving that you can teach an old dog new tricks.</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>Round
off lunch with a yogurt dessert, and you should be alert and ready to
face the stresses of the afternoon. That's because yogurt contains the
amino acid tyrosine, needed for the production of the neurotransmitters
dopamine and noradrenalin, among others. Studies by the US military
indicate that tyrosine becomes depleted when we are under stress and
that supplementing your intake can improve alertness and memory.</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>Don't
forget to snaffle a snack mid-afternoon, to maintain your glucose
levels. Just make sure you avoid junk food, and especially highly
processed goodies such as cakes, pastries and biscuits, which contain
trans-fatty acids. These not only pile on the pounds, but are
implicated in a slew of serious mental disorders, from dyslexia and
ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) to autism. Hard
evidence for this is still thin on the ground, but last year
researchers at the annual Society for Neuroscience meeting in San
Diego, California, reported that rats and mice raised on the rodent
equivalent of junk food struggled to find their way around a maze, and
took longer to remember solutions to problems they had already solved.</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>It
seems that some of the damage may be mediated through triglyceride, a
cholesterol-like substance found at high levels in rodents fed on
trans-fats. When the researchers gave these rats a drug to bring
triglyceride levels down again, the animals' performance on the memory
tasks improved.</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>Brains
are around 60 per cent fat, so if trans-fats clog up the system, what
should you eat to keep it well oiled? Evidence is mounting in favour of
omega-3 fatty acids, in particular docosahexaenoic acid or DHA. In
other words, your granny was right: fish is the best brain food. Not
only will it feed and lubricate a developing brain, DHA also seems to
help stave off dementia. Studies published last year reveal that older
mice from a strain genetically altered to develop Alzheimer's had 70
per cent less of the amyloid plaques associated with the disease when
fed on a high-DHA diet.</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>Finally,
you could do worse than finish off your evening meal with strawberries
and blueberries. Rats fed on these fruits have shown improved
coordination, concentration and short-term memory. And even if they
don't work such wonders in people, they still taste fantastic. So what
have you got to lose?</p>
        
        
	
        
            <h5>The Mozart effect</h5>
        
        
        
	
        
        
            <p><b>Music may tune up your thinking, but you can't just
crank up the volume and expect to become a genius</b></p>
        
        
            <p>A
DECADE ago Frances Rauscher, a psychologist now at the University of
Wisconsin at Oshkosh, and her colleagues made waves with the discovery
that listening to Mozart improved people's mathematical and spatial
reasoning. Even rats ran mazes faster and more accurately after hearing
Mozart than after white noise or music by the minimalist composer
Philip Glass. Last year, Rauscher reported that, for rats at least, a
Mozart piano sonata seems to stimulate activity in three genes involved
in nerve-cell signalling in the brain.</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>This
sounds like the most harmonious way to tune up your mental faculties.
But before you grab the CDs, hear this note of caution. Not everyone
who has looked for the Mozart effect has found it. What's more, even
its proponents tend to think that music boosts brain power simply
because it makes listeners feel better - relaxed and stimulated at the
same time - and that a comparable stimulus might do just as well. In
fact, one study found that listening to a story gave a similar
performance boost.</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>There
is, however, one way in which music really does make you smarter,
though unfortunately it requires a bit more effort than just selecting
something mellow on your iPod. Music lessons are the key. Six-year-old
children who were given music lessons, as opposed to drama lessons or
no extra instruction, got a 2 to 3-point boost in IQ scores compared
with the others. Similarly, Rauscher found that after two years of
music lessons, pre-school children scored better on spatial reasoning
tests than those who took computer lessons.</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>Maybe
music lessons exercise a range of mental skills, with their requirement
for delicate and precise finger movements, and listening for pitch and
rhythm, all combined with an emotional dimension. Nobody knows for
sure. Neither do they know whether adults can get the same mental boost
as young children. But, surely, it can't hurt to try.</p>

            <p>UNTIL
recently, a person's IQ - a measure of all kinds of mental
problem-solving abilities, including spatial skills, memory and verbal
reasoning - was thought to be a fixed commodity largely determined by
genetics. But recent hints suggest that a very basic brain function
called working memory might underlie our general intelligence, opening
up the intriguing possibility that if you improve your working memory,
you could boost your IQ too.</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>Working
memory is the brain's short-term information storage system. It's a
workbench for solving mental problems. For example if you calculate 73
- 6 + 7, your working memory will store the intermediate steps
necessary to work out the answer. And the amount of information that
the working memory can hold is strongly related to general intelligence.</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>A
team led by Torkel Klingberg at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm,
Sweden, has found signs that the neural systems that underlie working
memory may grow in response to training. Using functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) brain scans, they measured the brain activity
of adults before and after a working-memory training programme, which
involved tasks such as memorising the positions of a series of dots on
a grid. After five weeks of training, their brain activity had
increased in the regions associated with this type of memory (<i>Nature Neuroscience</i>, vol 7, p 75).</p>
        
        
	
        
        
        
            <div class="artquote">&#8220;<quote><quotetext>Working memory training could be the key to unlocking brain power</quotetext></quote>&#8221;</div>
        
	
        
        
            <p>Perhaps
more significantly, when the group studied children who had completed
these types of mental workouts, they saw improvement in a range of
cognitive abilities not related to the training, and a leap in IQ test
scores of 8 per cent (<i>Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry</i>,
vol 44, p 177). It's early days yet, but Klingberg thinks
working-memory training could be a key to unlocking brain power.
"Genetics determines a lot and so does the early gestation period," he
says. "On top of that, there is a few per cent - we don't know how much
- that can be improved by training."</p>

            <p>AN
AUDITORIUM is filled with 600 people. As they file out, they each tell
you their name. An hour later, you are asked to recall them all. Can
you do it? Most of us would balk at the idea. But in truth we're
probably all up to the task. It just needs a little technique and
dedication.</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>First,
learn a trick from the "mnemonists" who routinely memorise strings of
thousands of digits, entire epic poems, or hundreds of unrelated words.
When Eleanor Maguire from University College London and her colleagues
studied eight front runners in the annual World Memory Championships
they did not find any evidence that these people have particularly high
IQs or differently configured brains. But, while memorising, these
people did show activity in three brain regions that become active
during movements and navigation tasks but are not normally active
during simple memory tests.</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>This
may be connected to the fact that seven of them used a strategy in
which they place items to be remembered along a visualised route (<i>Nature Neuroscience</i>,
vol 6, p 90). To remember the sequence of an entire pack of playing
cards for example, the champions assign each card an identity, perhaps
an object or person, and as they flick through the cards they can make
up a story based on a sequence of interactions between these characters
and objects at sites along a well-trodden route.</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>Actors
use a related technique: they attach emotional meaning to what they
say. We always remember highly emotional moments better than less
emotionally loaded ones. Professional actors also seem to link words
with movement, remembering action-accompanied lines significantly
better than those delivered while static, even months after a show has
closed.</p>
        
        
        
            <p>Helga
Noice, a psychologist from Elmhurst College in Illinois, and Tony
Noice, an actor, who together discovered this effect, found that
non-thesps can benefit by adopting a similar technique. Students who
paired their words with previously learned actions could reproduce 38
per cent of them after just 5 minutes, whereas rote learners only
managed 14 per cent. The Noices believe that having two mental
representations gives you a better shot at remembering what you are
supposed to say.</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>Strategy
is important in everyday life too, says Barry Gordon from Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore, Maryland. Simple things like always putting
your car keys in the same place, writing things down to get them off
your mind, or just deciding to pay attention, can make a big difference
to how much information you retain. And if names are your downfall, try
making some mental associations. Just remember to keep the derogatory
ones to yourself.</p>
        
        
	
        
            <h5>Sleep on it</h5>
        
        
        
	
        
        
            <p><b><a name="sleep">Never underestimate the power of a
good night's rest</a></b></p>
        
        
            <p>SKIMPING
on sleep does awful things to your brain. Planning, problem-solving,
learning, concentration,working memory and alertness all take a hit. IQ
scores tumble. "If you have been awake for 21 hours straight, your
abilities are equivalent to someone who is legally drunk," says Sean
Drummond from the University of California, San Diego. And you don't
need to pull an all-nighter to suffer the effects: two or three late
nights and early mornings on the trot have the same effect.</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>Luckily,
it's reversible - and more. If you let someone who isn't sleep-deprived
have an extra hour or two of shut-eye, they perform much better than
normal on tasks requiring sustained attention, such taking an exam. And
being able to concentrate harder has knock-on benefits for overall
mental performance. "Attention is the base of a mental pyramid," says
Drummond. "If you boost that, you can't help boosting everything above
it."</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>These are
not the only benefits of a decent night's sleep. Sleep is when your
brain processes new memories, practises and hones new skills - and even
solves problems. Say you're trying to master a new video game. Instead
of grinding away into the small hours, you would be better off playing
for a couple of hours, then going to bed. While you are asleep your
brain will reactivate the circuits it was using as you learned the
game, rehearse them, and then shunt the new memories into long-term
storage. When you wake up, hey presto! You will be a better player. The
same applies to other skills such as playing the piano, driving a car
and, some researchers claim, memorising facts and figures. Even taking
a nap after training can help, says Carlyle Smith of Trent University
in Peterborough, Ontario.</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>There
is also some evidence that sleep can help produce moments of
problem-solving insight. The famous story about the Russian chemist
Dmitri Mendeleev suddenly "getting" the periodic table in a dream after
a day spent struggling with the problem is probably true. It seems that
sleep somehow allows the brain to juggle new memories to produce
flashes of creative insight. So if you want to have a eureka moment,
stop racking your brains and get your head down.</p>

            <p>IT'S
a dream come true for those who hate studying. Simply walking sedately
for half an hour three times a week can improve abilities such as
learning, concentration and abstract reasoning by 15 per cent. The
effects are particularly noticeable in older people. Senior citizens
who walk regularly perform better on memory tests than their sedentary
peers. What's more, over several years their scores on a variety of
cognitive tests show far less decline than those of non-walkers. Every
extra mile a week has measurable benefits.</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>It's
not only oldies who benefit, however. Angela Balding from the
University of Exeter, UK, has found that schoolchildren who exercise
three or four times a week get higher than average exam grades at age
10 or 11. The effect is strongest in boys, and while Balding admits
that the link may not be causal, she suggests that aerobic exercise may
boost mental powers by getting extra oxygen to your energy-guzzling
brain.</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>There's
another reason why your brain loves physical exercise: it promotes the
growth of new brain cells. Until recently, received wisdom had it that
we are born with a full complement of neurons and produce no new ones
during our lifetime. Fred Gage from the Salk Institute in La Jolla,
California, busted that myth in 2000 when he showed that even adults
can grow new brain cells. He also found that exercise is one of the
best ways to achieve this.</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>In
mice, at least, the brain-building effects of exercise are strongest in
the hippocampus, which is involved with learning and memory. This also
happens to be the brain region that is damaged by elevated levels of
the stress hormone cortisol. So if you are feeling frazzled, do your
brain a favour and go for a run.</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>Even
more gentle exercise, such as yoga, can do wonders for your brain. Last
year, researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles,
reported results from a pilot study in which they considered the
mood-altering ability of different yoga poses. Comparing back bends,
forward bends and standing poses, they concluded that the best way to
get a mental lift is to bend over backwards.</p>
        
        
	
        
        
        
            <p>And
the effect works both ways. Just as physical exercise can boost the
brain, mental exercise can boost the body. In 2001, researchers at the
Cleveland Clinic Foundation in Ohio asked volunteers to spend just 15
minutes a day thinking about exercising their biceps. After 12 weeks,
their arms were 13 per cent stronger.</p>

Mankato, Minnesota, might seem an unusual place for a pioneering
brain-science experiment. But a study of its 75 to 107-year-old
inhabitants is revealing more about keeping the brain alive and healthy
than perhaps any other to date. The "Nun study" is a unique
collaboration between 678 Catholic sisters recruited in 1991 and
Alzheimer's expert David Snowdon of the Sanders-Brown Center on Aging
and the University of Kentucky in Lexington.</p>

sisters' miraculous longevity - the group boasts seven centenarians and
many others well on their way - is surely in no small part attributable
to their impeccable lifestyle. They do not drink or smoke, they live
quietly and communally, they are spiritual and calm and they eat
healthily and in moderation. Nevertheless, small differences between
individual nuns could reveal the key to a healthy mind in later life.</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>Some
of the nuns have suffered from Alzheimer's disease, but many have
avoided any kind of dementia or senility. They include Sister Matthia,
who was mentally fit and active from her birth in 1894 to the day she
died peacefully in her sleep, aged 104. She was happy and productive,
knitting mittens for the poor every day until the end of her life. A
post-mortem of Sister Matthia's brain revealed no signs of excessive
ageing. But in some other, remarkable cases, Snowdon has found sisters
who showed no outwards signs of senility in life, yet had brains that
looked as if they were ravaged by dementia.</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>How
did Sister Matthia and the others cheat time? Snowdon's study, which
includes an annual barrage of mental agility tests and detailed medical
exams, has found several common denominators. The right amount of
vitamin folate is one. Verbal ability early in life is another, as are
positive emotions early in life, which were revealed by Snowdon's
analysis of the personal autobiographical essays each woman wrote in
her 20s as she took her vows. Activities, crosswords, knitting and
exercising also helped to prevent senility, showing that the old adage
"use it or lose it" is pertinent. And spirituality, or the positive
attitude that comes from it, can't be overlooked. But individual
differences also matter. To avoid dementia, your general health may be
vital: metabolic problems, small strokes and head injuries seem to be
common triggers of Alzheimer's dementia.</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>Obviously,
you don't have to become a nun to stay mentally agile. We can all
aspire to these kinds of improvements. As one of the sisters put it,
"Think no evil, do no evil, hear no evil, and you will never write a
best-selling novel."</p>

            <p>PAYING
attention is a complex mental process, an interplay of zooming in on
detail and stepping back to survey the big picture. So unfortunately
there is no single remedy to enhance your concentration. But there are
a few ways to improve it.</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>The
first is to raise your arousal levels. The brain's attentional state is
controlled by the neurotransmitters dopamine and noradrenalin. Dopamine
encourages a persistent, goal-centred state of mind whereas
noradrenalin produces an outward-looking, vigilant state. So not
surprisingly, anything that raises dopamine levels can boost your
powers of concentration.</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>One
way to do this is with drugs such as amphetamines and the ADHD drug
methylphenidate, better known as Ritalin. Caffeine also works. But if
you prefer the drug-free approach, the best strategy is to sleep well,
eat foods packed with slow-release sugars, and take lots of exercise.
It also helps if you are trying to focus on something that you find
interesting.</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>The
second step is to cut down on distractions. Workplace studies have
found that it takes up to 15 minutes to regain a deep state of
concentration after a distraction such as a phone call. Just a few such
interruptions and half the day is wasted.</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>Music
can help as long as you listen to something familiar and soothing that
serves primarily to drown out background noise. Psychologists also
recommend that you avoid working near potential diversions, such as the
fridge.</p>
        
        
	
        
            <p>There
are mental drills to deal with distractions. College counsellors
routinely teach students to recognise when their thoughts are
wandering, and catch themselves by saying "Stop! Be here now!" It
sounds corny but can develop into a valuable habit. As any Zen
meditator will tell you, concentration is as much a skill to be
lovingly cultivated as it is a physiochemical state of the brain.</p>
        
        
	
        
            <h5>Positive feedback</h5>
        
        
        
	
        
        
            <p><b><a name="positivefeedback">Thought control is easier

            <p>IT
SOUNDS a bit New Age, but there is a mysterious method of thought
control you can learn that seems to boost brain power. No one quite
knows how it works, and it is hard to describe exactly how to do it:
it's not relaxation or concentration as such, more a state of mind.
It's called neurofeedback. And it is slowly gaining scientific
credibility.</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>Neurofeedback
grew out of biofeedback therapy, popular in the 1960s. It works by
showing people a real-time measure of some seemingly uncontrollable
aspect of their physiology - heart rate, say - and encouraging them to
try and change it. Astonishingly, many patients found that they could,
though only rarely could they describe how they did it.</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>More
recently, this technique has been applied to the brain - specifically
to brain wave activity measured by an electroencephalogram, or EEG. The
first attempts were aimed at boosting the size of the alpha wave, which
crescendos when we are calm and focused. In one experiment, researchers
linked the speed of a car in a computer game to the size of the alpha
wave. They then asked subjects to make the car go faster using only
their minds. Many managed to do so, and seemed to become more alert and
focused as a result.</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>This
early success encouraged others, and neurofeedback soon became a
popular alternative therapy for ADHD. There is now good scientific
evidence that it works, as well as some success in treating epilepsy,
depression, tinnitus, anxiety, stroke and brain injuries.</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>And
to keep up with the times, some experimenters have used brain scanners
in place of EEGs. Scanners can allow people to see and control activity
of specific parts of the brain. A team at Stanford University in
California showed that people could learn to control pain by watching
the activity of their pain centres (<i>New Scientist</i>, 1 May 2004, p 9).</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>But
what about outside the clinic? Will neuro feedback ever allow ordinary
people to boost their brain function? Possibly. John Gruzelier of
Imperial College London has shown that it can improve medical students'
memory and make them feel calmer before exams. He has also shown that
it can improve musicians' and dancers' technique, and is testing it out
on opera singers and surgeons.</p>
        
        
	
        
        
            <p>Neils
Birbaumer from the University of Tübingen in Germany wants to see
whether neurofeedback can help psychopathic criminals control their
impulsiveness. And there are hints that the method could boost
creativity, enhance our orgasms, give shy people more confidence, lift
low moods, alter the balance between left and right brain activity, and
alter personality traits. All this by the power of thought.</p>
