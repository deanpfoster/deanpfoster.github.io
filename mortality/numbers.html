 <h1>The numbers behind the calculations</h1>

<h3> Health benefits </h3>

<h4>Exercise</h4>
1 hour exercise/week = 2*52/24 = 4 days longer life/year_lived		<br>
        2 hours life/hour exercise/week * 52 weeks/year_lived * 1/24 days/hour
<p>

<h4>Light exercise</h4>

up to 6 brisk walks of 30 minute each (per month!) reduced death rate by
30% over sedentary twin
<p>
more than 6 brisk walks per month decreased death rate by 44 percent
<p>
(source: JAMA Feb 11, 1998, as reported in Phil Inq)
<p>

<h4>Cigarettes</h4>
1 cigarette/day = -3.0 days life/year					<br>
        -12 min life/cigarette/day * 365 days/year  * 1/60 hours/min *
<br>
  	From American Cancer society (Science claims 5 minutes/cigarette)
<p>

<h4>To calculate life expectancy for the health benefits </h4>
        years_won = days_won/365     				<br>
        modified_life_expectancy = life_expectancy * (1 + years_won)


<h3> Hazards </h3>

<h4>Driving</h4>
1,000 miles/year driven =  -.00365  days life/year		<br>
        10^-8 deaths/mile/year * 1,000 miles/year * 365		<br>
	wearing seat belts reduces this by a factor of two	

<p>

<h4>To calculate life expectancy for the hazards </h4>

Directly modify the <a href="life-calc.html"> life table calculations
</a> with the change in the chance of dying each year.
