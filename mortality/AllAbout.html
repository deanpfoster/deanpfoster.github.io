<font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Predicting life expectancy is a very important
tool to enhance life itself. It brings&nbsp; greater accuracy and efficiency to calculations of insurance
premiums, economic forecasts and societal developments. Above all, it allows us to optimally plan our
life.</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="4"> Presently, life expectancy of an individual
is calculated primarily on the basis of sex, race, nationality and age. Some
life tables take smoking status into account as well. However, these few factors
are far from being exhaustive. There are many others that contribute to our life expectancies. This project
attempts to do just that- to include a host of other important variables to get
a much more accurate estimate of an individual's life expectancy.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="4"> Some of the many additional factors
accounted for include height, weight, education, income, marital status,
fitness, family health history, blood pressure, stress, driving, occupation,
nutrition, depression, sexual practices, and sleep.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="4"> An intra-year exponential distribution, with
the parameters being modified by individual relative risks, was used. Details of the
statistical procedure used can be found in&nbsp; <a href="References/DemoCalc.html">Demonstration
of Procedures</a>.</font></p>
