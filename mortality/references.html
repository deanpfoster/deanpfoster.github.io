University in Quebec, found that men who underwent screening had a
death rate from prostate cancer less than one third than men who
were not screened. Such a 69 percent reduction in deaths would
translate into 27,000 fewer deaths from prostate cancer in the
United States each year, Labrie said at the annual meeting of the
American Society of Clinical Oncology here.   (as quoted in the NYT)
