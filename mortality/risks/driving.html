<h1>Driving</h1>

<p>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that there
are 1.7 deaths per 100M miles driven in 1996.  45 percent of
fatalities were for people who didn't wear a seatbelt.  Around 32% of
the people don't wear a seatbelt. (It ranges by state from 26% to 39%.
Some states have seatbelt laws that actually are effective in changing
behavior.)  NHTSA claims that you get a 45% reduction in death if you
wear a seatbelt.
<p>
This means that the rate for not wearing a seatbelt is around 2.3
deaths per 100M miles and around 1.4 if you wear one.
