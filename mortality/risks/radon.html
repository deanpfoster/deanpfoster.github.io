<h1>Radon</h1>

<p>
<b>Philadelphia Inquirer, Feb 20th, 1998:</b> There are 2,000 to 3,000
lung-cancer deaths that are solely attributable to radon (in the US).

<p> For smokers, it contributes to about 15k - 22k lung-cancer deaths
each year.  There are about 160k lung-cancer cases a year.  

<p> The EPA suggest you take action if the level in your house is
above 4 picocuries per liter of air.  About 6% of all homes are above
this level.  It cost about $20 to have a test, and if you find Radon,
it costs about $2,000 to have it cleaned up.
