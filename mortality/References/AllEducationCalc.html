        relative risk of all cause mortality for men (only data
        for ages 25 to 59 were used as opposed to ages 60 to 74,
        as it was assumed that they represent the entire
        population better) with less than or equal to 9 years of
        education; 10 to 11 years of education and more than 11
        years of education is 1.20, 1.13, and 1 respectively</font></li>

        are 1.12586, 1.03072 and 0.79286.</font></li>

        relative risk, all the cause-specific lambda values are
        multiplied by the normalized relative risk.</font></li>
