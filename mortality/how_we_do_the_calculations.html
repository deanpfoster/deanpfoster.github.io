<h1>How we compute your life expectancy</h1>

We start with "<a href="life_table_discussion.html">life tables</a>",
which contain your base chance of dying each year.  The life tables
are for typical Americans doing typical amounts of exercise, smoking,
driving, etc.  We modify the base chances to fit your own personal
health habits.  This gives your chance of dying at each age, and hence
of living living one more year.  Averaging (summing the probability of
living to each age times that age) gives your "life expectancy".
<p>
Our page also gives you a 50% coverage interval for when you might
die.  If you are in the unlucky 25% of the people who are similar to
you in health habits, you will die before the lower age.  If you are
in the top 25%, you will live past the older age point.
<p>
The <a href="mathematics.html">math</a> is not hard.  
<P> 

For activities like driving, it is fairly easy to get reliable numbers
on how they effect your chance of death.  The entire auto insurance
industry makes sure this information is accurate!  But, for other
things, like exercise, or anti-oxedents, it is much more difficult to
get reliable data.  It is these <a href="numbers.html">numbers</a>
that are hard to come by and where we need your help!
