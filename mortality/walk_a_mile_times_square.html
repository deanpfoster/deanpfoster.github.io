<p> The above photograph is of times square.  It was taken (without permission)
 from <it>Smithsonian magazine</it> Feb 1998, page 43, in their
article about Times Square.  The modern Times Square has a cup of
coffee generating steam instead of a smoker blowing smoke.  Does this
say that coffee is the modern approved of addiction?
