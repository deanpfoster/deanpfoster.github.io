<h2>Definition of "advance"</h2>
Suppose I write a paper, but never get around to submitting it.  If it
actually is a good idea, someone else will publish it eventually.
Call this publication date T.  Now suppose that instead of putting the
paper in the draw I actually submit it and publish it.  Suppose it
comes out on date S.  Then the "advance" is the T-S.  This describes
the marginal contribution of the paper.
<p>

Unfortunately, a really bad idea might be published that NO-ONE else
would have ever considered publishing.  This would have an infinite
"advance" time.  So this definition doesn't capture all the social
value of a paper.

<h2>Calculations for my main streams of research</h2>
<ul>

<li> <em>Evolution and games (advance = 0 years)</em> While our paper was waiting for the
     printer we were shown a paper by  Kandori, Mailath, Rob (1993).
     Since we did beat them to press by 2 years, this might count as
     more than a zero year advance.  


  <li> <em>Calibration and no-regret (advance = 10 years)</em> In 1988, I started working
on forecasting problems in statistics that don't assume any
probabilisitic structure on the data.  I assumed this was a new idea;
it was a new idea in 1955, but not in 1988.  Neither I nor the
referees figured out that Blackwell (1956) and Hannan (1957) proved
the same thing.  Luckilly as Rick and point out in our review paper,
many others failed to discover this orginal Hannan results.  So if
this was all that I did in this area, I'd rate it as an advance of -33
years.

       <p>

But in 1991 Rick and I also came up with the idea of calibration and
no-regret.
