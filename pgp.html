<h1>Dean Foster's public key</h1>


Anyone can <a
href="http://www.cert.org/ftp/tech_tips/email_spoofing">spoof</a> an
email.  The easiest way to simply set the preferences in Netscape to
the email address you want to spoof.  So, if an email says it is from
santa@north.pole, don't believe it.  If everyone plays fair, mail
should be able to be traced back to its origin (see qmail's <a
href="http://www.qmail.org/qmail-manual-html/man7/forgeries.html">opinion
of this</a>).  On the other hand, only the person who knows the
private half of a public key/private key pair can sign an email
message using PGP.  So a signed email message either comes from the
person who knows the private key, or from the <a
href="http:www.nsa.gov">NSA</a>.  (Given the noises made by the US
government, it is possible that even the NSA can't spoof a PGP signed
email.)

<p> I'm using <a href="http://www.gnupg.org">gpg</a> to sign my
messages.  It is an open source produce produced by the people at <a
href="http:www.gnu.org">gnu</a>.  So if you want to verify that an
email actually comes from me, check it against my public signature
given below.  (I've also put my key on a public server or two, but
haven't ever gotten it signed.  So all the public server does for it
is it allows one to check that it hasn't changed in several year.)

<p>
Eventually everyone will sign their message as a matter of course.  Or
at least anyone who wants you to know who they really are will sign
their messages.  The only people who regularly send me emails that
probably don't want me to know their real address are spammers.  So
eventually a mail filter that doesn't pass messages that are unsigned
should remove all spam.  Now that is the correct way to end SPAM/junk
email!  No government intervention needed.

<h2>PGP fingerprint: </h2>

In an ideal world, you would have gotten the above fingerprint via
some hardcopy or possibly over the phone.  Possibly printed on the
backside of my business card.  In that case, you could download my
public key, and then ask your software to generate a fingerprint.  If
it didn't agree with the printed copy, you would know that you had
been attacked by a "man in the middle" attack.  Feel VERY special!  To
my knowledge, no-one has suffered such an attack (yet).
<p>
Putting the fingerprint here is totally useless for security purposes.
But for fun, you can check that it matches my public key below:
