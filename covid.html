<h1>Covid work</h1>
</center>

COVID-19: A few years ago several of us interupted our research to help
think about COVID.
<ul>
<li> In mid-March Lyle and I got excited about <a
href="./foster_ungar_contact_tracing.pdf">contact tracing</a>.  As a
tech person, the natural way of taking on contact tracing is via
technology:
<ul>
<li> A <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03544">protocol</a> we
created.

<li> A <a
href="https://ethics.harvard.edu/files/center-for-ethics/files/white_paper_5_outpacing_the_virus_final.pdf">expository
discussion</a> of contact tracing using technology.
<li> A <a
href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OQg2dxPu-x-RZzETlpV3lFa259Nrpk1J/view">letter</a>
to push Europe to not give up on privacy.
<li> And an <a href="https://covidsafe.cs.washington.edu/">App</a> to
implement these ideas.
<li> I have used these <a href="covid.pdf">cartoons</a> as a basis for a
fun little talk.
</ul>
<li>But, it actually is more important to do tracing by hand with tracers
talking to infected people instead of by using technology:
<ul>
<li> A <a
href="https://ethics.harvard.edu/files/center-for-ethics/files/roadmaptopandemicresilience_updated_4.20.20_0.pdf">position
paper</a> on general contact tracing to get us out of lock down.
<li> <a href="washington_state_letter.pdf">A letter</a> we wrote
targeted to Washington State.
<li> <a
href="https://ethics.harvard.edu/files/center-for-ethics/files/16localtargets.pdf">Requirements
for opening</a>. (And some more mathmatical background on <a href="tracers_needed.pdf">How many tests</a> will it take to
open one city.)
</ul>
