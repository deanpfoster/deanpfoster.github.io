<h1>The theory, science and religion of evolution</h1>

Evolution consists of two very different things.  One is the algorithm
of evolution itself (the theory).  The other is whether evolution
applies to our particular planet (the science).  The Huxley quote
about finding a watch implies a watch maker is an example of an
attack on the algorithm itself, whereas claims that we haven't found
several missing links is an attack on the application of evolution to
our planet.  One could call these two different pieces the "theory of
evolution" and the "science of evolution."

<p>
<h2>Comparing Evolution to Newtonian physics</h2>

These two pieces are similar to the two pieces that make up Newton's
contribution to science.  His two great contributions are his
invention of the calculus and his application of the calculus to
physics: A theory part and an application part.  The theory part of
Newton's work has been shown "wrong" but it still is what is taught
during a year of painful undergraduate mathematics.  In other words,
it is close enough to right to get useful answers.  The applications
part has also been shown to be wrong.  Newtonian physics is an
approximation to Einstein's relativity and to quantum mechanics.  But
again it is close enough to holding that it is taught in undergraduate
physics classes.  One can go around saying that Newton was wrong, but
it requires a fairly good knowledge of physics before you could back
such a statement up.  Once that level of knowledge is obtained,
usually what one is inclined to say is that it is a damn good
approximation to reality.  

 <p>
Let's return to evolution.  Before one attacks the theory part of
evolution it is a good idea to understand what it is that one is
attacking.  Amazingly enough, the theory part is almost entirely
unchanged from Darwin's original statement (particularly the first
edition of the _Origins of species_--in each successive edition it was
watered down a little bit to keep from annoying the truly religious--
Like his wife.)  Rather than reading the original, an easier way of
become familiar with the theory of evolution is to read Dennet's book
_Darwin's Dangerous Idea_.  Anyone who can finds a substantial hole in
either Darwin's original book or Dennet's exposition would be
instantly famous.  All it would take is one hole.  Such an objection
has not been found by anyone in the 100+ years since Darwin wrote his
book.  In other words, the theory has had much fewer changes than
Newton's theory has had.


 <p>


The second part of evolution is whether it fits the world or not.
This attack can not be done from the arm chair--it requires going into
the field and showing that some other theory fits the data better than
evolution does.  Given how many predictions of evolution have been
born out, any alternative theory had better be pretty close to
evolution or it won't be able to fit the data that evolution has
already fit.  In other words, the theory that replaces evolution will
be one that still leaves evolution as a damn good approximation.

<h2>Believing in evolution</h2>

It is said that 50% of Americans don't believe evolution.  This really
doesn't bother me very much.  Well over 50% of Americans don't
understand Newtonian physics well enough to use it to compute the path
of a baseball.  Probably less than 5% of Americans could use Newtonian
physics to describe why a top doesn't fall over when it is spinning.
So people who believe physics are believing something they haven't a
clue about.  They are simply bowing to authority.  Personally I think
this is no better than bowing to other forms of authoritarian sources
of knowledge.  It would be much better for these people to say, "You
know, I haven't a clue as to how to apply Newtonian physics.  They say
it explains gravity, baseballs and tops, but I can throw a mean
baseball without understanding the theory.  So I don't feel much need
to have an opinion on whether it is true or not.  I'll let others who
care more duke it out."  The fact that people "believe" Newtonian
physics tells us more about the ability of physicists to intimidate
people than it tells us about the truthfulness of the theory.

<p>

Physics is hard to understand--it does require understanding some
quite advanced mathematics.  So the fact that people give up on it
makes sense.  This is not true for evolution.  It is a quite simple
and easy to understand theory.  So what does bother me is that so many
people haven't every taken the time and energy to understand
evolution.  Once they understand it, I really don't care if they
believe it or not.  If they understand the theory, they pretty much
are forced to believe the theory part.  If they don't believe that it
is relevant for the world we live in, that simply shows that they live
in a city where the theory truly isn't relevant.

<h2>Teaching evolution</h2>

So teaching the theory part of evolution is a reasonable thing to
teach in school since it makes internal sense and is fun.  Teaching
the science of evolution requires discussing lots of different animals
and how they evolved to be the way they are.  This also would work
well since talking about animals always goes over well in classes.

<p>

But this isn't what people mean by "teaching evolution in schools."
What they mean is teaching that humans evolve from apes who evolved
from single cells muck.  This has no theoretical content since no one
can say why we evolved from apes.  Further, it has very low scientific
content since most of the species discussed are extinct.  So this sort
of lesson plan could be justified for indroctionation reasons, but
not for scientific reasons.  I personally view this sort of version of
evolution as identical to teaching creationism.  Teaching this sort of
evolution or teaching creationism both are unamerican since they
condone following authority rather than thinking for oneself.  I
personally call this the "religion of evolution."  

<p>

So I think the easiest scientific theory to teach is evolution.  It
can be described to elementary school students in a fashion they could
understand.  So it is a great theory to talk about.  I also think the
science of evolution should be taught in schools.  Dawkins describes a
wonderful demonstration that he does with insects concerning camiflog.
Other experiments can be done using currently existing animals.  Hence
they would relate to the world the student actually lives in.  It
would actually be science.

<p>

So I don't care about whether the religion of evolution is taught or
not.  If it is taught, hopefully a little theory and science will
creep in.  If it isn't taught, at least the students won't be confused
into thinking that scientist believe that some religion should pass
for science or theory.
