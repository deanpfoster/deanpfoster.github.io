<h1> Ophiuchus</h1>


I was lucky enough to be born under <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophiuchus_(astrology)">Ophiuchus</a>,
the 13th sign of the zodiac.  Due to <a
href="http://www.crystalinks.com/precession.html">precession</a> <!--
alternate cite: http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Sprecess.htm-->
of the earths axis, most people aren't born under the constellation
that then claim in the newspaper.  This has been known since about 130
bc.  This precession bothered the ancients, so they definition the
observations as being incorrect.  The first triumph of theory over
data.

is a defense of the the different ways of thinking about the
constellations from a believer in astrology.  It gets the science and
the history correct.
