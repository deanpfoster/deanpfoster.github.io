<h1>Story: A surprise quiz</h1>
</center>

<p>
When the regents of the university hear that it was possible to get a
doctorate of philosophy without even taking a single class in
philosophy, they wrote a new rule: "All Ph.D. candidate must take and
pass at least one course on philosophy."  This gladden the hearts of
the philosophy department, but annoyed the mathematicians since they
dreaded the prospects of having to write actual sentences!
<p>
It came to pass that Joe Math, a student of probability, was starting
to take the required philosophy.  The professor started out with the
usual admistrivia about the course:
<p>
"This is the remedial philosophy course for natural scientist.  Thus,
we will allow you to stay in the class as long as necessary to learn
the material.  At the end of each semester, if you haven't passed, you
will simply roll your points over to the next semester and no grade
will appear on your transcript.  This avoids having the stigma of
getting an F on your transcript."
<p>
"The grading will be based on written themes (one per week), exams (3
per semester) and pop-quizzes.  Grades will be the usual, 90% for A,
80% for B, etc.  As you are all graduate students, you have to get at
least a C to pass."
<p>
"To show you the power and clarity of logical thinking, I will give an
A to any student that catches me in a falsehood.  In all the years of
teaching, no student has ever managed to pass via this route."
<p>
One of the students raise her hand and asks, "How often will the
pop-quizzes be?"
<p>
The professor answers, "Each week there will be one pop-quiz.  (For
you non-native English speakers, pop-quiz means a quiz that you will
not know about ahead of time.)  If you feel that you have figured out
my pattern for giving pop-quizzes you are welcome to bet with me
before class about whether I'll give one that day.  Since you are
supposed to be sure, I will require you to give me 9 to 1 odds.  (In
other words, you should only bet if you are more than 90% sure of
winning.)  Since there are 5 days of class a week, you will have to do
significantly better than the base rate of 20% in order to improve
your standing."
<p>
At the mention of betting the probabilist starts paying attention.
"How much are we allowed to bet?"
<p>
"Oh, I didn't mean money - - I meant points for the class.  You can
bet up to the number of points that you have earned so far in class.
In fact, I value induction so well, that if you manage to leverage a
close to perfect grade in the class to one where by you have more than
105% total, I'll give you an A+."
<p>
A few days later the first pop-quiz was held.  The probabilist who
obviously hadn't done the reading (and in fact hadn't even gotten
around to buying the book yet) did lousy on it.  But the professor
felt charitable and gave him 3/10 points.  He attached a note saying,
"You will have to study if you want to pass this course."
<p>
On reading this, the probabilist became very happy.
