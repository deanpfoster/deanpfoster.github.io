Other theories miss the point of Darwinian explanations altogether. I
refer to suggestions like, ?Religion satisfies our curiosity about the
universe and our place in it.? Or ?Religion is consoling. People fear
death and are drawn to religions which promise we?ll survive it.?
There may be some psychological truth here, but it?s not in itself a
Darwinian explanation. As Steven Pinker has said in How the Mind Works
(Penguin, 1997):

. . . it only raises the question of why a mind would evolve to find
comfort in beliefs it can plainly see are false. A freezing person
finds no comfort in believing he is warm; a person face-to-face with a
lion is not put at ease by the conviction that it is a
rabbit. (p. 555)
