<h1>The Million dimensional Fed Ex problem</h1>
</center>
<p>
After your recent upgrade from a 3-Dimensional being to a million
dimensional super-being, you become faced with the problem of shipping
a ball.  In particular you want to ship a unit ball via Fed Ex.  THey
provide two forms of shipping, one is the Fed Ex box, which is very
expensive and the other is the fed Ex envelope, which is very cheap.
<p>
So the questions is, can you fit a unit ball into a fed ex envelope?
We will assume that the envelope actually allows a 1/50 unit of
width.  Unfortunately, your ball has a diameter of 1 unit.  So some
shaving will be required to fit it into the envelope.  In our
traditional 3 dimensinal space, you would have to shave off about 98%
of the ball before you could fit it into the envelope.  How about in
the million dimensional space?
<p>
<h2>The envelope please</h2>
The amount you have to remove would be 1 part in a googol.  In other
words, if 1 part in 10<sup>100</sup>.  If the ball were made up of
more atom than exist in our pathetic 3-D universe, you would have to
remove less than one atom to get it to fit.  
<h2>The Fed Ex tube</h2>
As one might expect, if you shaved in two different directions you
could fit the ball into a tube that was 1/50 of a unit in diameter.
You now would have to remove about 2 in a googol particles to do
this.
