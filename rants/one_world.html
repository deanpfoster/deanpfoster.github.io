<center><h1>One world vs. Many worlds</h1></center>

This story is to help me understand what a many worlds universe would
look like.  The idea is to slowly modify the "standard model" of
reality until it looks like a quantum mechnical parrelel universe.
<p>
Most peoples personal model of reality is similar to John Conway's
game of Life.  (cite?)  In other words, each small piece of reality
acts like a very small computer that talks to is neighbors and then
computes its next state.  The whole of reality consists of many
replicates of this computer in a masive grid.  There isn't any
ethernet that one piece of reality can use to communicate with a
distant piece of reality.  The only way information can flow great
distances is to get there one step at a time.
<p>
If you use great imagination, you can actually get a general
relativity model to look something like the "standard model."
Einstien believed in the standard model so much, that he was unwilling
to believe quantum mechanics could actually be a correct description
of the world.  Let's now beat on the standard model and see if we can
get it to look more quantum mechinical.
<p>
Physics is reversible.  So instead of using standard logic for our
nodes of reality, let's replace them with reversible logic.  Standard
logic uses things equations like (A and B), but in reversible logic,
we have to be able to recover the inputs from the outputs, so we can't
compute (A and B).  So what can we compute in a reversible fashion?
The identity is reversable.  (Duh!)  So is negation.  In fact,
negagion is its own inverse.  The function f(A,B) -> (A, A xor B) is
also reversable and its own inverse.  A general class of reversable
functions is
<center>
f(A,B,C,...,Z) = (A,B,C,..., Z xor g(A,B,C,...))
</center>
This provides us with a large arsinal of functions.  So instead of
Conway's rules for life, we need to use some other rules made out of
these reversible rules.
<p>
<h3>The "Game of Ghosts"</h3>
Suppose that at each node of our the game of life we put some extra
bits of information.  The first bit tells us whether the node is
"alive" or "dead."  The extra bits are there to allow the whole thing
to be reversible.  It isn't easy to see how one could build a
reversible game of life.  Consider what happens when two gliders
destroy each other at time <em>t</em>.  At time <em>t+1</em> there is
nothing left on the board.  But we have to be able to compute
backwards to generate the gliders that existed at time <em>t</em>.
Further we have to be able to compute the state <em>t+1</em> from the
information we have at time <em>t+2</em>.  Thus the gliders will have
to have some of their essesense last forever after they are gone.
This essence is called their ghost.  The ghost preceeds them before
they are called into existance and their ghost lives on after they are
gone.

Technical note: It is unfortunately impossible to construct the game of
ghost.  No reversible grid can simulate the game of life in real
time.

<p>
So it isn't a great step to believe in a reversable world over
believing in the standard model of the world.  In fact, Newton believe
that one could predict forward in time or backward in time equally
well.  If one had perfect knowledge of the current state of the world,
forward and backwards predictions can be computed from Newton's three
laws of mechanics.  (Chaos requires us to have perfect knowledge
instead of merely really good knowledge.)

<h3>A string of pearls</h3>

Once we assume reversibility, we can figure out all the future and all
the past from a snap shot of time.  Thus we can think of this as been
a long string of pearls--each pearl being a single snapshot of the 
world.  There aren't any decisions to be made or branches to
consider.  Everything goes merilly along in either direction.  Any
feeling of the passage of time is simply an illusion.  It might
actually be that time runs backwards--we just feel that it is running
forwards.  There wouldn't be any difference between these two 
approaches. 
<p>
<h3>Weaving the strings together</h3>

How can we make branches but still maintain our reversibility?
What we want to see is a single string of pearls before the branch
point, and then two strands of pearls after the branch point.  It
would be trivial to identify which way time was flowing if we allowed
this sort of structure.  But we want branches.  
<p>
If we have two strands of pearls after the branch point, we then have
to have two stands before the branch point.  So our picture now looks
like two strings running along, that then cross at the branch point.
Using ascii art, it looks something like
<center>
======<sub><sup><sup>x</sup></sup></sub>=======. 
</center>
<p>
The way to think about this is to use the fact that our system is
reversable.  Suppose that the branch point is a randomization done at
the point (3,7) on the board.  Then before the randomization we have
two possible starting position that differ only in the value at the
location (3,7).  Afterwards, we also have two different positions that
differ at the point (3,7).  Now propogate all four ends sticking out
of this cross to generate two whole worlds.  Each of these two worlds
appears to have a branch in it.  But this branch works both in a time
forward and a time reversed fashion.  Hence we have satisfied our
reversibility AND allowed for a branch.
<p>
Things start getting uglier when you want two branch points. Each
world line is attached to its neighbor either at the first branch or
at the second branch.  Likewise its neighbor is attached to another
neighbor and so on.  This generates a zig-zag pattern.  If we are
lucky, we might be able to reuse one of the previous worlds to link
the whole think up into a ring.  
<p>
Allowing for three branch points generates an even more complex
picture.  Assuming that we don't get to reuse our world lines, we
rapidly get an exponential number of necessary worlds.  In other
words, the number of worlds that are within <em>n</em> links of our
world is <em>2<sup>n</sup></em>.  If we don't close them back on
themselves we rapidly get more than can be drawn easilly in a
picture. 
<p>
Luckilly things don't get all that much worse if you have <em>k</em>
decision points.  There are <em>(k-1)<sup>n</sup></em> worlds that are
within <em>n</em> steps, which isn't all that much larger than the 3
decision case.

<h3>Markov chains</h3>
