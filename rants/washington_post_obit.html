Phillips W.

Dr. Foster joined the Maryland faculty in 1962 and soon began teaching a course on the environment. In the 1970s, he taught a popular ecology course that was held in one of the largest lecture halls on the College Park campus.

He wrote more than 100 scholarly papers, and his wide-ranging academic interests included agriculture, international development, nutrition, population growth and preschool education.

During academic sabbaticals, Dr. Foster spent extended periods of time in India, Australia, Algeria and Colombia, and he was among the first U.S. scholars invited to lecture on economics in China. From 1968 to 1971, he wrote, directed and produced a documentary film about a village in rural India and its struggles to adapt long-held traditions to modern life.
