<h1>Drink efficiency: The best buzz for your waist line</h1>

Of course you should never drink alcohol.  You shouldn't drink it
because it tastes good.  You shouldn't drink it because it will make
you live longer.  You shouldn't drink it for the buzz.  You shouldn't
drink it as a social activity.   In
cooking it's OK, as long as you boil all the alcohol out of it!

<p> Now that the lawyers are happy, how should you get drunk without
getting fat?  Here are the efficiencies of a variety of drinks.  Feel
free to email me other drinks to add to the list.

<p> The scores given below are simply the fraction of calories that come
from the alcohol.  So it can be figured out by using 7 * (grams of OH)
/ (Total calories).  The data pretty much all comes from <a
href="http://www.calorieking.com/">The calorie King</a> web site.
If it comes from someone else I'll provide a cite.
<p>
If you are into mixed drinks--this page will not help you.  Feel free
to figure out the correct answer and email it to me (<em>dean@foster.net</em>).
