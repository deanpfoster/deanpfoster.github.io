<li> The number of Israelis killed in road accidents since
independence in 1948 is greater than the number killed in wars and
terrorist attacks.  In 2002, 522 Israelis were killed in road
accidents. 20,500 Israelis have been killed in wars and terrorist
attacks between May 1948 and May 2003, compared with 21,600 killed in
road accidents. (<a
href="http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview/id/309898.html">source</a>)
So why do good numerate people worry more about my visiting Israel for
the terror than for the autos? (Aside: the number of death from cars in
Israel is about 1/2 that for a comparable number of americans.)


<li> A cute <a
href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/09/15/science/20080915_NUMBER_SENSE_GRAPHIC.html">dot
counting test </a>.  It is supposed correlate with your math ability.
But no one knows why this should be.
 <li> A great rant from <a
href="http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/lomborg14">Bjorn
Lomborg:</a> "If you reduce your child's intake of fruits and
vegetables by just 0.03 grams a day (that's the equivalent of half a
grain of rice) when you opt for more expensive organic produce, the
total risk of cancer goes up, not down. Omit buying just one apple
every 20 years because you have gone organic, and your child is worse
off."
<p>
Now I just need a place to put it on our mortality page.

<li> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpjrHzgSRM">Bad power
point</a> presentations much too common.  Tufte recommends just using
a handout.  (Watch it--its funny!)
<li> The picture at right will probably get my entire cite banned by
some automatic software.  By copying this picture all over the
net--the goal is to embarass people into not using such software.  The
random quote at the bottom of this page is a second attempt at getting
my site banned. 

<li>
 Science presented a silly graphic in a recent issue that Robert Stine
made <a href="../graph.html">dynamic.</a>  So we (Robert Stine Kate
Propert and I) wrote a <a href="science_graph.html">comment</a> on it,
which Science was unwilling to publish.  Thank got for vanity
publishing on the web!

<li> I actual believe that cryptograph can solve some things.  Bruce
     Schneier used to believe, but his current book he loses the faith.  <a
     href="../system_notes/secrets_and_lies_book_review.html">Here</a> is
     my review of his book.

<li> Let me weigh in on the <a href="evolution.html">teaching of
     evolution</a> in our schools.  I actually believe evolution is
     the most beautiful and accurate theory ever created.  But what is
     taught in schools is more often the religion of evolution.

<li> Dawkin's wrote <a
     href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4257777,00.html">this</a>
     rant for the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/">Guardian</a> that I
     really wish I had written.  He
     points out that religion dehumanizes life in ways that can't be
     matched by science.  (I've mirrored this rant <a
     href="dawkins_on_religion.html">here</a>.) (see also <a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/politicsphilosophyandsociety/story/0,6000,664342,00.html">Salman Rushdie</a>.)

 <li> Deirdre
McCloskey wrote a nice <a href="
http://chronicle.com/free/v48/i25/25b01401.htm">rant</a> against the
usual accedemic policy of getting letters for P & T.

<li> Emails sent to me (foster@wharton.upenn.edu) become the
property of the University of Pennsylvania unless they are
encrypted.<sup><a href = "../pgp.html#penn">1</a></sup> Consider this
policy a first step towards <a href =
"http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/right-to-read.html">Stallman's
nightmare.</a>

</ul>


<h2>Raves:</h2>
<ul>
<li> This is a <a
href="http://www.thewisdomjournal.com/Blog/what-me-stressed-a-stress-test-and-tips-to-reduce-stress/">stress
test</a> which I heard about as a child.  I'm amazed that so few
people know this research.  Basically, changes in life are
stressful--AND stress leads to measurable health problems.

<li> Religion, lack of control and seeing patterns: all <a
href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126941.700-born-believers-how-your-brain-creates-god.html?full=true">here</a>
from the new scientist.
<li> My favorite
<a href="http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?w0=t&w3=sfcwind&w4=sky&w5=pop&w8=rain&AheadHour=0&Submit=Submit&FcstType=graphical&textField1=39.95250&textField2=-75.16570&site=all&unit=0"> weather</a> view of philly.
<li> Cute <a href="http://vimeo.com/2424744">graphic</a> showing
imigration to the US over 100 years.  

<li> Have you ever wondered how to convert an amazon sales rank to
sales per week? Here is an  <a href="http://www.fonerbooks.com/surfing.htm">answer</a>.

 <li> Gopen and Swan's wrote a nice piece writing: "<a
href="http://www.amstat.org/publications/jcgs/sci.pdf">The Science of
Scientific Writing</a>."

<li> <a href="http://www.mp3music.co.il/lyrics/e9e4e5e3e9fa_f8e1e9f5.html">Lyrics</a>
for some Hebrew songs that I'm using to learn how to read Hebrew.
<li> I love <a href="million_d_fedex.html">high dimensional spaces</a>.

<li> My favorite <a
href="http://www.danegallery.com/glasswarebyrober.html">wine glasses</a>
 are available from Robert Dane made them and has a <a href="http://www.danegallery.com/">gallery</a>.

<li> <a href="http://www.baen.com/library/">Bean Free Library</a> has
some good SF titles for download for free.  Kinda cool!  They admit
that these are teaser--since they are frequently the first few books
in long series that you might <a href="http://www.webscription.net/baen/">buy</a>.

<li> A cute <a href="www.xkcd.com">cartoon</a> which often has piece
on linux.
<li> Philosophers have written many papers about what is called the
     "surprise quiz."  I've only written <a
     href="a_surprise_quiz.html">one</a> and its in the form of a
     story.

<li> I was very lucky to be born under <a
     href="ophiuchus.html">ophiuchus</a>, the 13th sign of the zodiac.

<li>
The  <em><a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/">American Scientist</a></em> has an <a
href="http://www.americanscientist.org/template/AssetDetail/assetid/15654?fulltext=true&print=yes">article</a>
on spiders that yeild to intruders.  Very nice evolutionary game theory.

<li> <a href="http://groupsites.ius.edu/physics/E/Risk.html">A nice
discussion </a> of risk and the preception of risk.  I'm not sure I
believe all his numbers.
<li> I like red wines.  They are pretty good on a <a
href="alcohol.html">alcohol/calorie</a> basis.  They are even better
for overall health.

<li> I recently started programming with Ruby.  Its been a joy.  In my
first day, I wrote 1000 lines of <a href="../doc">code</a> that
actually made sense.  Unfortuantely, the <a
href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.htm?tiobe_index">poplularity</a> of
ruby is only slightly ahead of fortran!  But it is up and coming.

<li> My friend and colleague Mike Steele has an interesting twist on
the impending bird flu epedemic.  Namely, what about the <a
href="http://birdflueconomics.blogspot.com/">economy</a>? 

<li> Ok, let me put in a rave just for balance.  <a
     href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/tweller/">Tom
     Weller</a> wrote a cool book called <a
     href="http://www.besse.at/sms/smsintro.html">science made
     stupid</a>.   If you find an actual copy, please buy it.  If you
     find two, buy them both and send me one.  <a
     href="http://www.skeptic.net/Snark_Awards/Snark_Award_Science_Made_Stupid.htm">Sceptic.net</a>
also thinks he's cool.

<li> I own all the books written by <a
href="http://www.co.uk.lspace.org/books/reading-order-guides/the-discworld-reading-order-guide-colour-1-25.gif">Terry
Pratchet</a>.  You should start too!

<li> A nice <a href="http://www.eh.net/hmit/compare/">deflator</a>
which computes the value of US dollars over time.  Useful when reading
about history.

<li> <a href="http://paulgraham.com/procrastination.html">Here</a> is
a lovely article on procrastination.  The author would encorage you to
put of reading it to work on better things.  But your sufing the web
now aren't you?  So give it a read!


  <li> I've been using really bad maps on the web for years.  But
finally there is a really <a href="http://www.be.map24.com/">
good one</a>.  Give it a try!

  <li> For a nice discussion of the similarity between power laws and
log normals see <a
href="http://www.internetmathematics.org/volumes/1/2/pp226_251.pdf">this
paper</a>.

  <li> Lyle Ungar wrote up a way of <a
href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ungar/Wine/">saving wine</a> that I
find very useful.

  <li> This <a href="http://classweb.gmu.edu/accent/">cite</a> has you
listen to various accents and see how they are recorded in a standard
notation.  To get a handle on the IPA listen <a
href="http://www.paulmeier.com/ipa/charts.html">here</a>. 

  <li> A cool science site is based on the idea of a <a href="http://www.edge.org/">the 3rd culture.</a>

  <li> <a href="http://www.cut-the-knot.com/">cut-the-knot</a> is a
       wonderful web site for expository mathematics.  Now I just have
       to get him to add statistics and I won't have to teach any more!

  <li> There is a wonderful <a
href="http://www.bikemap.com/philadelphia.html">biking map</a> of the
Philly area.  (The map in the center is the one I like.)  You can get
hard copy from local bike store.

  <li> Ever wonder how many people play on a team?  We put this <a
href="sports_by_the_numbers.html">list</a> together.
