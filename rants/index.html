<h1> Dean Foster's Rants</h1>


<p>
<h2>Rants: </h2>

<UL>

<li> The number of Israelis killed in road accidents since
independence in 1948 is greater than the number killed in wars and
terrorist attacks.  In 2002, 522 Israelis were killed in road
accidents. 20,500 Israelis have been killed in wars and terrorist
attacks between May 1948 and May 2003, compared with 21,600 killed in
road accidents. (<a
href="http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview/id/309898.html">source</a>)
So why do good numerate people worry more about my visiting Israel for
the terror than for the autos? (Aside: the number of death from cars in
Israel is about 1/2 that for a comparable number of Americans.)

<li>
 Science presented a silly graphic a few years ago.  So we (Robert Stine, Kate
Propert and I) wrote a <a href="science_graph.html">comment</a> on it,
which Science was unwilling to publish.  The advantage of it now being
a web publication, is that the cool dynamic graphic works better than
it would in hard copy.

<li> I actual believe that cryptograph can solve some things.  Bruce
     Schneier used to believe, but his current book he loses the faith.  <a
     href="secrets_and_lies_book_review.html">Here</a> is
     my review of his book.

<li> Let me weigh in on the <a href="evolution.html">teaching of
     evolution</a> in our schools.  I actually believe evolution is
     the most beautiful and accurate theory ever created.  But what is
     taught in schools is more often the religion of evolution.

 <li> A great rant from <a
href="http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/lomborg14">Bjorn
Lomborg:</a> "If you reduce your child's intake of fruits and
vegetables by just 0.03 grams a day (that's the equivalent of half a
grain of rice) when you opt for more expensive organic produce, the
total risk of cancer goes up, not down. Omit buying just one apple
every 20 years because you have gone organic, and your child is worse
off."   (<a
href="http://andrewgelman.com/2012/02/confusion-from-illusory-precision/">Gelman
</a> discussed this quote.)



<li> A nice tirade by Norvig against <a
href="http://norvig.com/chomsky.html">Chomsky</a>. 
<li> Dawkin's wrote <a
     href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4257777,00.html">this</a>
     rant for the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/">Guardian</a> that I
     really wish I had written.  He
     points out that religion dehumanizes life in ways that can't be
     matched by science.  (I've mirrored this rant <a
     href="dawkins_on_religion.html">here</a>.) (see also <a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/politicsphilosophyandsociety/story/0,6000,664342,00.html">Salman Rushdie</a>.)

 <li> Deirdre
McCloskey wrote a nice <a href="
http://chronicle.com/free/v48/i25/25b01401.htm">rant</a> (<a
href="http://www.deirdremccloskey.com/docs/pdf/Article_318.pdf">ungated
version</a>) against the
usual accedemic policy of getting letters for P & T.

<li> Emails sent to me (foster@wharton.upenn.edu) become the
property of the University of Pennsylvania unless they are
encrypted.<sup><a href = "../pgp.html#penn">1</a></sup> Consider this
policy a first step towards <a href =
"http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/right-to-read.html">Stallman's
nightmare.</a>

</ul>


<h2>Raves:</h2>
<ul>

<li> Ok, let me put in some raves just for balance.  <a
     href="http://tweller.com/">Tom
     Weller</a> wrote a cool book called <a
     href="http://www.besse.at/sms/smsintro.html">science made
     stupid</a>.   If you find an actual copy, please buy it.  If you
     find two, buy them both and send me one.  

<li> There is lots of research that shows that the best way to learn
something is to struggle and mostly succeed.  So for example, if you
want to learn vocabulary, reading with material just above your level
is prefect. (The idea behind AR for example.)  So a perfect
application for this theory would be to learn <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet">IPA</a>
to read texts in your native language written in this format.  But on 
the entire web, all I can find are the following <a
href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090605222928/http://www.umanitoba.ca/faculties/arts/linguistics/russell/138/practice/texts/texts.htm"">5
articles.</a>.  Too bad!  (And even those five have been deleted.  So the
link is via the very cool <a
href="http://www.archive.org/web/web.php">wayback machine</a>.)

  <li> This <a href="http://classweb.gmu.edu/accent/">site</a> has you
listen to various accents and see how they are recorded in a standard
notation.  To get a handle on the IPA listen <a
href="http://www.paulmeier.com/ipa/charts.html">here</a>. 


<li> <a
href="http://jonnybowden.com/ebooks/29TipsForAHealthierLife.pdf">29
tips for a healthier life</a>.  

<li> The Washington Post ran an <a
href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/04/AR2010090403237.html">obit</a>
on my dad. (<a href="washington_post_obit.html">cached</a>)  He wrote
a <a href="life-phil.pdf">time line</a> of his life a few years back
as an exercise for his memory (this was post bike accident).
<li> A cute <a
href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/09/15/science/20080915_NUMBER_SENSE_GRAPHIC.html">dot
counting test </a>.  It is supposed correlate with your math ability.
But no one knows why this should be.
<li> This is a <a
href="http://www.thewisdomjournal.com/Blog/what-me-stressed-a-stress-test-and-tips-to-reduce-stress/">stress
test</a> which I heard about as a child.  I'm amazed that so few
people know this research.  Basically, changes in life are
stressful--AND stress leads to measurable health problems.

<li> Religion, lack of control and seeing patterns: all <a
href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126941.700-born-believers-how-your-brain-creates-god.html?full=true">here</a> (<a href="http://www.mindpowernews.com/BrainGod.htm">ungated</a>)
from the new scientist.
<li> My favorite
<a href="http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?w0=t&w3=sfcwind&w4=sky&w5=pop&w8=rain&AheadHour=0&Submit=Submit&FcstType=graphical&textField1=39.95250&textField2=-75.16570&site=all&unit=0"> weather</a> view of philly.
<li> Cute <a href="http://vimeo.com/2424744">graphic</a> showing
imigration to the US over 100 years.  

<li> Have you ever wondered how to convert an amazon sales rank to
sales per week? Here is an  <a href="http://www.fonerbooks.com/surfing.htm">answer</a>.

 <li> Gopen and Swan wrote a nice piece on writing: "<a
href="http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/id.877,y.0,no.,content.true,page.1,css.print/issue.aspx">The Science of
Scientific Writing</a>."

<li> I love <a href="million_d_fedex.html">high dimensional spaces</a>.

<li> My favorite <a
href="http://www.danegallery.com/glasswarebyrober.html">wine glasses</a>
 are available from Robert Dane made them and has a <a href="http://www.danegallery.com/">gallery</a>.

<li> <a href="http://www.xkcd.com">XKCD</a> is a nice cartoon which often has
nice jokes about linux and sometimes about statistics: <a
href="http://xkcd.com/539/">boy friend</a>, <a
href="http://xkcd.com/552/">correlation</a>, and <a
href="http://xkcd.com/892/">null hypothesis</a>.


<li> Philosophers have written many papers about what is called the
     "surprise quiz."  I've only written <a
     href="a_surprise_quiz.html">one</a> and its in the form of a
     story.

<li> I was very lucky to be born under <a
     href="ophiuchus.html">ophiuchus</a>, the 13th sign of the zodiac.

<li>
The  <em><a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/">American Scientist</a></em> has an <a
href="http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/id.814,y.0,no.,content.true,page.1,css.print/issue.aspx">article</a> ("<a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/animal-contests-as-evolutionary-games/1">Animal Contests as Evolutionary Games</a>")
on spiders that yeild to intruders.  Very nice evolutionary game
theory. 

<li> <a href="http://groupsites.ius.edu/physics/E/Risk.html">A nice
discussion </a> of risk and the preception of risk.  I'm not sure I
believe all his numbers.
<li> I like red wines.  They are pretty good on a <a
href="alcohol.html">alcohol/calorie</a> basis.  They are even better
for overall health. 

<li> I mostly program in C++.  But two other languages I use are Ruby
and R.  It is nice to see that the  <a
href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html">poplularity</a> of
both are now doing pretty well.

<li> My friend and colleague Mike Steele has an interesting twist on
the impending bird flu epedemic.  Namely, what about the <a
href="http://birdflueconomics.blogspot.com/">economy</a>? 

<li> I own all the books written by <a
href="http://www.co.uk.lspace.org/books/reading-order-guides/the-discworld-reading-order-guide-colour-1-25.gif">Terry
Pratchet</a>.  You should start too!

<li> A nice <a href="http://www.eh.net/hmit/compare/">deflator</a>
which computes the value of US dollars over time.  Useful when reading
about history.

<li> <a href="http://paulgraham.com/procrastination.html">Here</a> is
a lovely article on procrastination.  The author would encorage you to
put of reading it to work on better things.  But your sufing the web
now aren't you?  So give it a read!


  <li> Before google took on maps, my favorite was <a
href="http://www.be.map24.com/"> map 24</a>.  Give it a try!


  <li> Lyle Ungar wrote up a way of <a
href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ungar/Wine/">saving wine</a> that I
find very useful.  Though now a days, we just put the wine in plastic
bottles that we can crumple to squeeze out all the extra air.  Not as
pretty--but keeps out the O2 just as well.


  <li> A cool science site is based on the idea of a <a href="http://www.edge.org/">the 3rd culture.</a>

  <li> <a href="http://www.cut-the-knot.com/">cut-the-knot</a> is a
       wonderful web site for expository mathematics.  Now I just have
       to get him to add statistics and I won't have to teach any more!

  <li> Ever wonder how many people play on a team?  We put this <a
href="sports_by_the_numbers.html">list</a> together.

  <li> Broken links:
    <ul> 


  <li> For a nice discussion of the similarity between power laws and
log normals see <a
href="http://www.internetmathematics.org/volumes/1/2/pp226_251.pdf">this
paper</a>.
