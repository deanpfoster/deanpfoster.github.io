<h1>Gandhi's ten principles of nonviolence</h1>
</center>

<ol>
  <li> Humiliating or deliberately provoking your opponent invites
       violence;
  <li> Knowing your facts and arguments well helps avoid violence;
  <li> If you are open about your cause your opponent is less likely
       to be violent;
  <li> Look for common ground between you and your opponents to
       promote trust and understanding;
  <li> Do not judge others harder than yourself (alternatively do not
       judge others);
  <li> Try to trust your opponent. They will sense this trust;
  <li> Compromise on inessential items to promote resolution;
  <li> Sincerity helps convert your opponent;
  <li> By making personal sacrifice you show your sincerity;
  <lI> Avoid exploiting weakness in your opponent. Aim for integrity,
       not simply to win.
