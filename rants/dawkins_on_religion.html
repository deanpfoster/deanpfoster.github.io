A guided missile corrects its trajectory as it flies, homing in, say,
on the heat of a jet plane's exhaust. A great improvement on a simple
ballistic shell, it still cannot discriminate particular targets. It
could not zero in on a designated New York skyscraper if launched from
as far away as Boston. <P>That is precisely what a modern "smart
missile" can do. Computer miniaturisation has advanced to the point
where one of today's smart missiles could be programmed with an image
of the Manhattan skyline together with instructions to home in on the
north tower of the World Trade Centre. Smart missiles of this
sophistication are possessed by the United States, as we learned in
the Gulf war, but they are economically beyond ordinary terrorists and
scientifically beyond theocratic governments. Might there be a cheaper
and easier alternative?  <P>In the second world war, before
electronics became cheap and miniature, the psychologist BF Skinner
did some research on pigeon-guided missiles. The pigeon was to sit in
a tiny cockpit, having previously been trained to peck keys in such a
way as to keep a designated target in the centre of a screen. In the
missile, the target would be for real.  <P>The principle worked,
although it was never put into practice by the US authorities. Even
factoring in the costs of training them, pigeons are cheaper and
lighter than computers of comparable effectiveness. Their feats in
Skinner's boxes suggest that a pigeon, after a regimen of training
with colour slides, really could guide a missile to a distinctive
landmark at the southern end of Manhattan island. The pigeon has no
idea that it is guiding a missile. It just keeps on pecking at those
two tall rectangles on the screen, from time to time a food reward
drops out of the dispenser, and this goes on until... oblivion.
<P>Pigeons may be cheap and disposable as on-board guidance systems,
but there's no escaping the cost of the missile itself. And no such
missile large enough to do much damage could penetrate US air space
without being intercepted. What is needed is a missile that is not
recognised for what it is until too late. Something like a large
civilian airliner, carrying the innocuous markings of a well-known
carrier and a great deal of fuel. That's the easy part. But how do you
smuggle on board the necessary guidance system? You can hardly expect
the pilots to surrender the left-hand seat to a pigeon or a computer.
<P>How about using humans as on-board guidance systems, instead of
pigeons? Humans are at least as numerous as pigeons, their brains are
not significantly costlier than pigeon brains, and for many tasks they
are actually superior. Humans have a proven track record in taking
over planes by the use of threats, which work because the legitimate
pilots value their own lives and those of their passengers.  <P>The
natural assumption that the hijacker ultimately values his own life
too, and will act rationally to preserve it, leads air crews and
ground staff to make calculated decisions that would not work with
guidance modules lacking a sense of self-preservation. If your plane
is being hijacked by an armed man who, though prepared to take risks,
presumably wants to go on living, there is room for bargaining. A
rational pilot complies with the hijacker's wishes, gets the plane
down on the ground, has hot food sent in for the passengers and leaves
the negotiations to people trained to negotiate.  <P>The problem with
the human guidance system is precisely this. Unlike the pigeon
version, it knows that a successful mission culminates in its own
destruction. Could we develop a biological guidance system with the
compliance and dispensability of a pigeon but with a man's
resourcefulness and ability to infiltrate plausibly? What we need, in
a nutshell, is a human who doesn't mind being blown up. He'd make the
perfect on-board guidance system. But suicide enthusiasts are hard to
find. Even terminal cancer patients might lose their nerve when the
crash was actually looming.  <P>Could we get some otherwise normal
humans and somehow persuade them that they are not going to die as a
consequence of flying a plane smack into a skyscraper? If only! Nobody
is that stupid, but how about this - it's a long shot, but it just
might work. Given that they are certainly going to die, couldn't we
sucker them into believing that they are going to come to life again
afterwards? Don't be daft! No, listen, it might work. Offer them a
fast track to a Great Oasis in the Sky, cooled by everlasting
fountains. Harps and wings wouldn't appeal to the sort of young men we
need, so tell them there's a special martyr's reward of 72 virgin
brides, guaranteed eager and exclusive.  <P>Would they fall for it?
Yes, testosterone-sodden young men too unattractive to get a woman in
this world might be desperate enough to go for 72 private virgins in
the next.  <P>It's a tall story, but worth a try. You'd have to get
them young, though. Feed them a complete and self-consistent
background mythology to make the big lie sound plausible when it
comes. Give them a holy book and make them learn it by heart. Do you
know, I really think it might work. As luck would have it, we have
just the thing to hand: a ready-made system of mind-control which has
been honed over centuries, handed down through generations. Millions
of people have been brought up in it. It is called religion and, for
reasons which one day we may understand, most people fall for it
(nowhere more so than America itself, though the irony passes
unnoticed). Now all we need is to round up a few of these faith-heads
and give them flying lessons.  <P>Facetious? Trivialising an
unspeakable evil? That is the exact opposite of my intention, which is
deadly serious and prompted by deep grief and fierce anger. I am
trying to call attention to the elephant in the room that everybody is
too polite - or too devout - to notice: religion, and specifically the
devaluing effect that religion has on human life. I don't mean
devaluing the life of others (though it can do that too), but
devaluing one's own life. Religion teaches the dangerous nonsense that
death is not the end.  <P>If death is final, a rational agent can be
expected to value his life highly and be reluctant to risk it. This
makes the world a safer place, just as a plane is safer if its
hijacker wants to survive. At the other extreme, if a significant
number of people convince themselves, or are convinced by their
priests, that a martyr's death is equivalent to pressing the
hyperspace button and zooming through a wormhole to another universe,
it can make the world a very dangerous place. Especially if they also
believe that that other universe is a paradisical escape from the
tribulations of the real world. Top it off with sincerely believed, if
ludicrous and degrading to women, sexual promises, and is it any
wonder that naive and frustrated young men are clamouring to be
selected for suicide missions?  <P>There is no doubt that the
afterlife-obsessed suicidal brain really is a weapon of immense power
and danger. It is comparable to a smart missile, and its guidance
system is in many respects superior to the most sophisticated
electronic brain that money can buy. Yet to a cynical government,
organisation, or priesthood, it is very very cheap.  <P>Our leaders
have described the recent atrocity with the customary cliche: mindless
cowardice. "Mindless" may be a suitable word for the vandalising of a
telephone box. It is not helpful for understanding what hit New York
on September 11. Those people were not mindless and they were
certainly not cowards. On the contrary, they had sufficiently
effective minds braced with an insane courage, and it would pay us
mightily to understand where that courage came from.  <P>It came from
religion. Religion is also, of course, the underlying source of the
divisiveness in the Middle East which motivated the use of this deadly
weapon in the first place. But that is another story and not my
concern here. My concern here is with the weapon itself. To fill a
world with religion, or religions of the Abrahamic kind, is like
littering the streets with loaded guns. Do not be surprised if they
are used.  <P>Richard Dawkins is professor of the public understanding
of science, University of Oxford, and author of The Selfish Gene, The
Blind Watchmaker, and Unweaving the Rainbow.  <P>
