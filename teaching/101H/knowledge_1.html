<h1> Knowledge can be represented by sigma-algebras</h1>

<h2>Example of information</h2>

Game: 30 cents to buy in.  Win $1 if you get the Ace of hearts.  10
cards in all.  Any takers?
<ul>
  <li> Suppose I tell you the denomination of the card?  Any takers?
  <li> Suppose I tell you the color (red/black) of the card?  Any takers?
  <li> Detail: The cards are the 4 aces and 6 other clubs.
  <li> This is called an option.  Payment is max(E(Win|know)-.3,0).
  <li> We need to konw what the expected value of this option is to decide.
  <li> Three cases:
       <ul>
	 <li> trivial knowledge: E(Win|know) = E(win).  Option worth zero.
	 <li> know Number: E(Win|know) = .25 or 0.  Option worth zero.
	 <li> know color: E(Win|know) = .5 or 0.  Option worth 4 cents.
       </ul>
  <li> So what you know matters.
  <li> Options of this sort are studied in finance
</ul>

<h2> Example of two players</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Suppose 3 cards are in a "deck" (2 black and 1 red)
  <li> Each of two players get one card.
  <li> Call the remaining card the "kitty"
  <li> Computing some probabilities:
       <ul>
	 <li> What is the expected probability that the kitty is black? 
	 <li> Conditional on first player seeing his card? (100%/50%)
       </ul>
  <li> Learning from actions:
       <ul>
	 <li> Suppose the second player sees the first player bet that the kitty will be black?
	 <li> What is her conditional probability that the kitty is black?
	 <li> Suppose the second player sees the first player NOT bet that the kitty will be black?
	 <li> What is her conditional probability that the kitty is black?
	 <li> So the second player then KNOWS the color of the card.
       </ul>
  <li> Knowledge about actions
       <ul>
	 <li> What is "her" probability that "he" will bet on black?
       </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Representing all of this</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Each players knowledge is represented by a sigma-field
  <li> Sample space contains 6 items: draw it.
  <li> Draw each sigma-field.
  <li> After we see the first player bet, the sigma-field is updated.
</ul>
