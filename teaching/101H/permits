We are targeting that class for Joseph Wharton Scholars and Huntsman
students.  I'm willing to consider exceptional other cases, but it
will have to be a very strong case.  (I'd also want you to plan on
continuing through 102 since I would prepare you for neither 431 nor
regular 102.)

Hi Dean,

I need their social security number and then I will issue them a permit for
your honors section, after I issue the permit the student must go to
PennInTouch to register.  But if the student is a engineering student they
must first get permission from Joseph Sun, sunj@seas.upenn.edu because
engineering students are not allowed to take STAT-101 & 102.
Please tell the student to have Joseph Sun email me if it's okay for the
student to take the course.
