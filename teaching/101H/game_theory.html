<h2>Web links about last lecture</h2>
<ul>
  <li> see <a
       href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/model/node13.html">here</a>
       for a gruesome description.
  <li> see <a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/model/node12.html">here</a>
       for a formal discussion from a philosophers perspective.

<h2>The common knowledge sigma-fields</h2>
<ul>
  <li> the intersection of two sigma fields
  <li> Represents everything BOTH people know
</ul>

<h2>The cheating sigma-fields</h2>
<ul>
  <li> The union of two sigma 
</ul>

<h2>The god sigma-fields</h2>
<ul>
  <li> The algebra where everything has to be mesasureable
</ul>

<h2> A game matrix</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Game of chicken
  <li> Newlywed game 
  <li> Prisinors dilemma game 
</ul>
<h2>Rationality (or greedy)</h2>
<ul>
  <li> One player rationality:
       <ol>
	 <li> Pick the best action (not good enough--best action might change)
	 <li> Pick the best action possible (too good, they might not know which is best)
	 <li> Pick the best action given what they know (just right)
       </ol>
  <li> Same thing as symbols: (X = random variable representing the
       action choosen.  x is another possible action.) 
       <ol>
	 <li> E(U(X)) >= E(U(x))
	 <li> U(X) >= U(x)
	 <li> E(U(X)|KnowledgeX) >= E(U(x)|KnowledgeX)
       </ol>
  <li> Two players: Each is rational
       <ul>
	 <li>  E(U(X,Y)|KnowledgeX) >= E(U(x,Y)|KnowledgeX) 
	 <li>  E(U(X,Y)|KnowledgeX) >= E(U(x,Y)|KnowledgeX) 
       </ul>
</ul>
<h2>Example distributions for PD</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Equal probabilities in PD
  <li> Any probabilities in PD
  <li> Concept: called dominance
  <li> Can use U(X) >= U(x) definition of rationality
</ul>
<h2>Example distributions for newlywed game</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Try equal probabilities (one row is rational other isn't)
  <li> Try 50/50 on diagonal (each row is rational)
  <li> Probably the "correct" solution to this game
</ul>
<h2> Overall model</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Each player has his/her own sigma-algebra
  <li> There is a common knowledge sigma-algebra
  <li> there is a "cheatting" sigma-algebra
  <li> There is the mother sigma-algebra
  <li> Nash assumed:
       <ul>
	 <li> Two primary algebras are independent
	 <li> common knolwdege is trivial
	 <li> Cheat = mother 
       </ul>
  <li> Mixed Nash drops common knowlwdge is trivial
  <li> CE drops independence of two primary algebras
  <li> Bayesian drops Cheat = mother
  <li> These issues have lead to 30 years of fighting
</ul>
