<h2>MLE's and where we are in the course</h2>

Summary of course:
<ul>
  <li> Regression: practical, most situations (more = stat 202)
  <li> Design: important science (more = biostatistics)
  <li> Math Stat: MLE (more = stat 432, new course)
  <li> If you hark back for the good old days of probability (more = stat 433)
</ul>

<h2>Section 4.1</h2>

<h3>Key construction</h3>

density is f<sub>theta</sub>(x)
<p>
likelihood f<sub>x<sub>(theta)
<p>
What is the difference?  Real question is what is a function?

<h3>Principle: maximizing probably better than minimizing</h3>
Find large value of likelihood function
<p>

What is large?  Bigger than competitors.  (I.e. is likelihood = .001
large?  Yes, if next best is .000001).

<p>
Define max and arg max
<h3>Example 1: binomial</h3>
use theta for parameter.  (It is the general symbol).
<ul>
  <li> First do it with likelihood
  <li> Notice that there are two parts: the interesting part and the
       likelihood part again
  <li> If we divided by the likelihood it would be prettier
  <li> So: do log likelihoods
  <li> REDO CALCULATION
</ul>

<h2><a href="homework.html">Homework</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li> Read pages 68 - 71 of handout.  Read them again!  Make sure you
       understand the notation itself, not just the ideas.
