<h2>Administrivia</h2>

<ul>
  <li> First part of project due next week (or ASAP, whichever comes first).
</ul>

<h2>Chapter 2: Observational studies</h2>

<h3>Controlling</h3>

Control means many things:
<ul>
  <li> controlled experiment = randomized controlled experiment
  <li> control = subject who wasn't given treatment
  <li> controlled for = variable added to regression to remove colinearity
</ul>
<h3>Model</h3>
Additive model:
<ul>
  <li> Y = alpha + beta * I<sub>treatment</sub> + beta * X's
  <li> Y = alpha + beta * I<sub>treatment</sub> + beta * I<sub>treatment</sub> * X's
  <li> hidden correlation is enough to mess up trial
  <li> Called confounding
</ul>
<h3>Does smoking cause cancer?</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Ideal experiment: randomized controlled experiment
  <li> Ethical experiment: "natural" experiment.  Say, WWII: GI's were
       given free cigerettes.  More got addicted than those that
       didn't go.  But the two groups are very different.
  <li> Handle each confounder individually: Age, sex, genetics,
       income, education, exercise, nutrition, etc.
  <li> But, you also have to handle all the confounders at the same
       time!
</ul>
<h3>Compliers/Adherers vs non-compliers</h3>

In a randomized clinical trial, clofibrate didn't effect heart
disease. (21% vs 20%).
<ul>
  <li> But many didn't take the drug
  <li> Of the 80% assigned to take the drug that took it, 15% died.
       VS 25% of those that didn't comply.
  <li> Sounds like the drug is effective?
  <li> Compare to placebo-non-compliers: 15% vs 15%.
</ul>
In clinical trials, it is important that placebo is as "tasty" as the
treatment, so difference in compliance aren't created.

<h3>Gool observational studies require goo investigative journalism</h3>
What else could be going on?
<ul>
  <li> Pellagra occurs in households, in southern Europe.  Then in
       southern US.  In homes that have more fly's than average.
       Spread from spain to italy to US.  Sound like an infectious
       disease?  No, it was niacin.
  <li> Jews and Moslems have circumcision and lower cervical cancer.
       Casual?  No: current theory is it is a STD.
  <li> Almost any relationship between two variables can be explained
       by some "story."  That a reasonable story can be found doesn't
       provie support of the theory.
</ul>
<h3>Sex bias</h3>

Berkeley admits about twice as many men as women.  Is this discrimination?
<ul>
  <li> What cofounders
  <li> More men apply: After correcting for that it is 45% vs 35%
  <li> Which field: men apply to easy fields
  <li> Controling for field: more women are admitted
</ul>

<h2><a href="homework.html">Homework</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li> Read chapters 1 and 2 of FPP(A)
  <li> Do the first part of your <a href="project_2.html">Second project</a>.
  <li> Read through the review exercises (page 24) with your project group.
       Discuss each question and come up with an answer.
</ul>
