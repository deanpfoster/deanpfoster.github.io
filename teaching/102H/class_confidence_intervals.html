<h1>Statistics 102H: Confidence intervals</h1>
</center>
<p>

<h2>Predicting a long term forecast</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Goal of science: predict future predictions!
  <li> (No need to predict truth--that is ahead of your time)
  <li> But, if you predict future predictions, they will all have to
       <a href=""http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/cs">cite you!</a>
</ul>
<h2>Ignore future variation: only look at statistical error</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Y - y-hat = prediction interval
  <li> EY - y-hat = confidence interval
  <li> Note: Y - y-hat = (Y - EY) - (EY - y-hat)
       <ul>
	 <li> difference of two independent random variables
	 <li> hence variances add
	 <li> Variance of Y-EY is constant
	 <li> variance of EY-y-hat grows as we get far from the data
	      we have previously collected
       </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Where does statistical error come from?</h2>
<ul>
  <li> A little background:
       <ul>
	 <li> Regression does least squares
	 <li> solution to least squares is linear combination of error + truth
	 <li> Hence normality sets in and CLT sets in
	 <li> E(alpha-hat) = alpha  (This is called unbiased)
	 <li> E(beta-hat) = beta  (This is called unbiased)
       </ul>
  <li> Thus accuracy of alpha and beta depend on where the data is collected
  <li> more spread out X's generate better slope estimates
  <li> But might introduct unwanted data to problem. Hence design of where to put the X's must take care.
  <li> Error looks like sigma/sqrt(n)sigma(X)
</ul>
<h2>Translating this statistical error into confidence intervals</h2>
<ul>
  <li> y-hat = alpha-hat + beta-hat x
  <li> So errors in alpha-hat and beta-hat lead to errors in
       y-hat
  <li> unfortunately, alhpa-hat and beta-hat are correlated
  <li> So formula is kinda ugly
</ul>

<h3>Cell phones</h3>
<ul>
  <li> pages 29-38 and pages 53-56
  <li> Extrapolation is where the fun is!  (And the danger)
  <li> Looks like March 2002 = 180 Million (Current statistics: <a
       href="http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2002/BogusiaGrzywac.shtml">here</a>).
</ul>


<h3>Cottages</h3>
<ul>
  <li> pages 78 - 85, and 89 - 98
  <li> Does linear regression really capture the spread of confidence?
  <li> Consider confidence intervals for polynomial regression.  YIKES!
</ul>


</ul>
<h2>Homework</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Be sure you understand all the pictures in the first three
       chapters of the book.  The primary issues is to understand WHY
       they were generated, not how. 
  <li> Read blurb on page 109.  Look at the car89 data using simple
       regression.   Don't follow the book--just play around with the
       data.
  <li> Look at the <a
       href="http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/">stat-lib data
       archive</a>.  Find a data set that sounds interesting--read it
       into JMP and analyse it.  Examples that might be of interest:
       <ul>
	 <li> <a
	      href="http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/sleep">sleep</a>
	      (question: does size affect hours of sleep?  Does 
       predation affect hours of sleep?)
	 <li> <a href="http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/wseries">world
	      series</a> (question: Is there a home field advantage? 
	      Has it increase or decrased over time?)
	 <li> <a
	      href="http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/places.data">places</a> looks at various
	      properties of places: crime, transportation, education.
	      If you don't want to unpack it, I"ve done so here:
	      (<a href="statlib/PLACES.DAT">.DAT</a>, <a
	      href="statlib/PLACES.documentation">.documentation</a>, <a
	      href="statlib/PLACES.KEY">.KEY</a>) 
       </ul>
       Notice: you will probably have to use an editor and maybe excel
       to read these into JMP.  Be sure to page to the bottom of the
       file in case there are suprises!  (Sometimes there is a
       different data set at the bottom of the file.)
</ul>
