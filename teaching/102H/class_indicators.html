<h1>Statistics 102H: Colinearity</h1>
</center>
<p>

<h2>Administrivia</h2>

<ul>
  <li> project due after spring break (also first midterm is after spring break)
</ul>


<h2>Homework discussion</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Generally looked good
  <li> Show a few pictures from student homeworks
</ul>

<h2>Parcel Handling (page 148.)</h2>

This problem is colinearity where it matters.  

<ul>
  <li> Log lives on percentile scale
       <ul>
	 <li> log(1 + epsilon) = epsilon
	 <li> Always use base e if you want to talk about percents!
	 <li> compounding percents leads to exponental 
       </ul>
  <li> log-log models
       <ul>
	 <li> log(Y) = alpha + beta log(X)
	 <li> Y = alpha' X<sup>beta</sup>
	 <li> Intrinsically a power-law relationship
	 <li> Nicely captures deminishing marginal returns 
	 <li> Called elasticities
       </ul>
  <li> Converting elasticities to slopes and back
  <li> Now look at book/data
</ul>

<h2>Categorical variables</h2>

Employee performance: page 161.
<p>
We will follow the book carefully on this one.

<h2><a href="homework.html">Homework</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li> Find the categorical variables in your project
  <li> Do a cross tabs to see how colinear they are
  <li> Look at a variety of relationships between the categorical
       variables and the continuous variables. 
  <li> Use a formula to convert a two-category variable into an
       indicator function.  Now it can be summarized by a correlation
       with other variables.  Why doesn't this work if there are three
       categories?  
</ul>
