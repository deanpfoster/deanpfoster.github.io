<h1>Statistics 102H:  Assumptions</h1>
</center>
<p>

<h2>Questions about homework?</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Any questions about managed benifits?
       <ul>
	 <li> Notice, transformations maintain monotonicity
	 <li> Hence, none could fix it
	 <li> graphcally captured by bulging rule
       </ul>
  <li> I'll discuss crime data in class today.
</ul>

<h2>Checking assumptions</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Recall our assumptions:
       <ul>
	 <li> Independence
	 <li> Normality
	 <li> Homoskadasticity
	 <li> (see page 44-46)
       </ul>
  <li> Save residuals
  <li> Use brushing to see how connected to Y
  <li> Make histogram of residuals (show Q-Q plot)
</ul>

<h2>Isolated points</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Trouble or an anoynance?
       <ul>
	 <li> If violation of assumptions it is trouble
	 <li> Otherwise, merely an anoynance.  Deal with it!
       </ul>
  <li> deviations in Y direction = trouble (called outlier)
  <li> deviation in X direction  = anoynance (called high leverage point)
  <li> BOTH = big trouble! = (called influential outlier)
</ul>
<h2>Cottages</h2>
<ul>
  <li> important points might be leveraged
</ul>

<h2>Housing prices</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Isolated points
  <li> Leverage calculation
  <li> leave-one-out fit (using JMP)
  <li> various transformations
  <li> Tukey calls this pealing the statistical onion
</ul>

<h2>Why use a model?</h2>
<ul>
  <li> By having a model we can
       <ul>
	 <li> Talk about how new data will behave.
	 <li> describe new data using only 3 numbers!
	 <li> know how accurate future predictions will be.
       </ul>
  <li> Prediction intervals in JMP
</ul>

<h2>Homework</h2>
<ul>
  <li> If you didn't look at examples I mentioned last time DO SO! 
  <li> Revisiting Display ft.
       <ul>
	 <li> We look two transformation: log(x) and 1/X
	 <li> Make both of these transformations using the formula editor in JMP
	 <li> Now plot Y vs the new variable log(x)
	 <li> Now plot Y vs the new variable 1/x
	 <li> Which fits better? 
	 <li> Which graph seems more useful for economics? the orginal graph given in the book, or the ones you just created?
	 <li> Which graph seems more useful for Statistics? In other words, which can you check your assumptions better using?
       </ul>
  <li> You should now have looked at all the examples (except cell phones) upto page 95.
  <li> Re-read introduction to class 2 (p 39 - 52).  
</ul>
