<h1>Statistics 102H: Multiple regression</h1>
</center>
<p>

<h2>Administrivia</h2>

<ul>
  <li> I made up a <a href="homework.html">homework page</a>.
  <li> Homework due date pushed back
</ul>


<h2>Car data (cont'd)</h2>

See page 109 of revised edition.  We will follow the book very
carefully on this one.

<h2>t statistics</h2>
<ul>
  <li> |t| > 2 is .05 level of significance
  <li> Tests if the slope MIGHT be zero.
  <li> If the slope were actually zero, then less than 5% of the time
       should the |t| be bigger than 2.
  <li> JMP gives p-values that are easier to interpret.  Is the
       p-value less than .05?
</ul>

<h2><a href="homework.html">Homework</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li> Finish the <a href="homework_1.html">first assignment</a>.
  <li> look at <a
       href="http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/archive.htm">am
       stat archive</a>.  Pick a dataset that sounds interesting (say
       AAUP, car, or baseball).  Pick an interesting Y variable
       and do a multiple regression.   Match all the pictures we
       generated in class 4.  You should be able to understand both
       how to interpret each graph and why it is important to generate
       it.
</ul>
