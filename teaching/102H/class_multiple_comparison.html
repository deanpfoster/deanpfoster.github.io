<ul>
  <li> I put up a sample exam.  Email me your answers, and I'll give
       you the correct back!  (Maybe I"ll post the answers 1/2 way

</ul>

<p>
Blackboard work:

  <li> What if you did lots of tests?  How many would reject?
  <li> Bonferonni p-value = (# tries) * regular p-value
  <li> (Sorry these notes are so short.  I do research in this area,
       so I know it really really well!)
</ul>
