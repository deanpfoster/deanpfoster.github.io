       Maintaining a normal body mass index, engaging in regular
physical activity and undergoing screening for prostate cancer can
help stop disease progression, US research shows.  <p>

       In a six-year study of 1,117 patients with localised prostate
cancer, researchers from the University of Texas looked at prostate
specific antigen levels, the aggressiveness of the cancer-- measured
by a biopsy Gleason score -- and the size of the tumour.
 <p>

       The researchers discovered that patients with a high risk of
progression were significantly more likely to be obese, to exercise
less than twice a week and to not undergo annual prostate screening.
<p>
   
    On the contrary, those with the lowest risk kept their weight
down, undertook regular exercise and were screened regularly for signs
of the What we are finding has positive implications for prostate
cancer according to Dr Mfon Cyrus-David of the s department of It
appears to be important that men maintain a low body mass index,
exercise to the point of sweating at least two times a week, and are
screened regularly for prostate he says.
<p>
   
    The researchers emphasise that their conclusions are preliminary
and a follow-up study is needed to validate their findings.
       <p>

       The study is one of the first to attempt to quantify the
predictive risk that lifestyle factors have on whether or not prostate
cancer will recur in patients who have been treated.
<p>
       The findings were due to be revealed at the cancelled meeting
of the American Association of Cancer Research in Toronto, Canada,
this week.

<h2>Chapter 27: two boxes</h2>

<h3>SE of two boxes</h3>
All good statistics consists of contrasts
<ul>
  <li> if you exercise you will ... compared to if you don't exercise
  <li> if you get a undergraduate degree you will earn more ... compared to if you don't
  <li> etc
</ul>
How do we analyse these exeperiments?
<ul>
  <li> Consider two boxes: A and B
  <li> draw from each box
  <li> subtract means = estimate of difference
  <li> What is the SE?
</ul>
Var(X - Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y) - 2 Cov(X,Y)
<p>
With luck, the covariance is zero
<ul>
  <li> Say if independent
</ul>
Hence: SE(difference) = sqrt(SE<sub>A</sub><sup>2</sup>+SE<sub>B</sub><sup>2</sup>)
<h3>Z statistic for difference</h3>
Z = (observed - target)/SE
<h3>Experiments</h3>
One box: two labels on each ticket
<ul>
  <li> Difficulty: only observe one of two values
  <li> Dependent draws typically (i.e. choose sample, then randomize as to which half of ticket to observe)
  <li> Difference is easy
  <li> But what is the SE?
  <li> Amazingly enough: same as before
</ul>
<h3>If we observed both halfs of ticket?<h3>
<ul>
  <li> just take the difference and you have a single ticket problem!
</ul>
<h3>page 514: Tversky trial</h3>

<ul>
<li> Phrasing of question.
<li> order effect of questions
</ul>

<h2><a href="homework.html">Homework</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li> Read chapter 26.  In particular, read sections 5 - 8.  I didn't cover them, but you are responsable for them.
  <li> What will your test statistic be in your project?  (You might not be able to answer this yet if your project involves a regression)
