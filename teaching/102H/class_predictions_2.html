<h1>Statistics 102H: Predictions and CI (cont'd)</h1>
</center>
<p>

<h2>Can't the preditions just deal with bad data?</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Try a linear fit to curved data (look at prediction intervals)
  <li> Try a linear fit to hetroskadastic data (look at prediction intervals)
  <li> Coverage variaries depending on where you are in the data
  <li> sometimes 100% (i.e. too wide)
  <li> sometimes 50% or less (i.e. too narrow)
  <li> Hence looking at graph is VERY important
</ul>

<h2>At least some of these we can fix</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Transformations for hetroskadasticity
  <li> What is a transformation?
       <ul>
	 <li> Suppose "log(Y) vs X" and and "Y vs exp(X)" both fit equally well.
	 <li> Which to use?
	 <li> Different prediction bounds
	 <li> Do actual transformation
       </ul>
  <li> Example of picking a transformation:
       <ul>
	 <li> picking between log-log and 1/X model in housing data
	 <li> Generate all the new variables
	 <li> Plot on new axis
	 <li> Which is less hetroskadastic?
       </ul>
  <li> Example useful for linear case:
       <ul>
	 <li> Cleaning crews data
	 <li> linear-linear  or should we use log-log or sqrt-sqrt?
	 <li> Plot prediction intervals on orginal graph to see
	 <li> Save residuals
       </ul>
  <li> The log-log transformation (elasticities)
       <ul>
	 <li> consider the asteroid data
	 <li> raw plot is very ugly (sketch picture)
	 <li> too extream in both directions
	 <li> log-log tames a whole range of values
       </ul>
</ul>
       <h2>Homework</h2>
       <ul>
       </ul>

       <hr>
       (next time?)
    
<h2>What about that statistical error?</h2>
<ul>
  <li> A little background:
       <ul>
	 <li> Regression does least squares
	 <li> solution to least squares is linear combination of erorr + truth
	 <li> Hence normality sets in and CLT sets in
	 <li> E(alpha-hat) = alpha  (This is called unbiased)
       </ul>
  <li> Thus accuracy of alpha and beta depend on where the data is collected
  <li> more spread out X's generate better slope estimates
  <li> But might introduct unwanted data to problem. Hence design of where to put the X's must take care.
  <li> Error looks like sigma/sqrt(n)sigma(X)
</ul>


<h3>Cell phones</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Current statistics: <a href="http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2002/BogusiaGrzywac.shtml">here</a>.
  <li> Looks like March 2002 = 180 Million?
</ul>
