<h2>Administrivia</h2>

<ul>
  <li> pass out evaluations
  <li> I emailed comments.  If you need your data analysis back, come and get it.  
  <li> I'll pick out some questions that look like exam questions and put them on the homework page.
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>Homework</h3>
  <li> Page 84 of handout:
       <ul>
	 <li> 4.1 just compute the MLEs for each case
	 <li> 4.2
	 <li> 4.3 (skip the "not idenifiable" part)
	 <li> 4.6 (skip simple approximation)
	 <li> BONUS: 4.7 is hard!  It requires doing some geometry.
       </ul>

<h3>Review for exam</h3>

<h2>Science</h2>
<ul>
  <li> What does it take to prove a scientific claim?
  <li> What are the biases that you need to look for?
  <li> Understand the box model: be able to answer if a scientific experiment is a box model or not.
  <li> Primary goal: be an intelegent consumer of modern science.  Read a story and identify why it isn't real science.
       <ul>
	 <li> Study: Death certificates of taller people have younger ages.  Do people shrink as they get older?  Does being talk cause death?  Or is there a lurking variable?
	 <li> Study: Primary end point is AIDS.  Vacine doesn't work.  But, for a subset (black and latinos) it does have a p-value less than .05.  Is it real or not?
       </ul>
</ul>
<h2>Mathematical statistics</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Be able to relate probabilistic models to statistics
  <li> Identify the parameter
  <li> Be able to compute the MLE
  <li> Know what the Fisher Information is (i.e. the negative of the 2nd dervative)
</ul>


<hr>

<h2><a href="homework.html">Homework</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li> Study hard!  I'll post some sample questions later.
</ul>
