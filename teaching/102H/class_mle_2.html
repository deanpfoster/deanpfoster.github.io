<h2>Administrivia</h2>

<ul>
  <li> data analysis due monday
  <li> If you have any questions about how your data analysis, include
them with what you turn in and I'll email you an answer.
  <li> I wrote up details of what the rest of the projct should entail.       
  </ul> <hr>

<h3>Example 1: binomial (cont'd)</h3>
Last time we did the binomial my maximizing f.  It was ugly.  Lets redo it by maximizing log f.
  
<h3>Example 2: normal theory</h3>
Full likelihood is product of individual likelihoods.  (Only do mu not
sigma). 
<ul>
  <li> God it is ugly!
  <li> Take logs.  Ah, a bit prettier
  <li> Ignore constants.  Thats more like it!
  <li> Take derivative
  <li> Complete the square also: this is where leasts squares comes
       from 
</ul>
<h3>Calculating the MLE</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Book uses D for multi-derivative.  we will stick with single
       derivatives in class.
  <li> Two term taylor series: log likelihood = l(theta<sub>0</sub>) +
       ...
  <li> DEEP THEOREM (LeCam): This is a  VERY good approximation.
       Almost exact 
       up to several standard errors.  (This is what I studied in my
       thesis.  I didn't prove it.  I just tried to understand it.)
  <li> So maximum is at -b/2a.  Or take dervatives.  Or use Newton's
       method. 
</ul>
<h3>First useful example</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Suppose there are outliers in the data
  <li> You can handle it using ideas of the first part of hte course
  <li> Now lets do it carefully.
  <li> Need a distribution that generates outliers: Cauchy
  <li> Compute the score
  <li> Notice: large values are down-weighted!  Just like you do when
       you remove them!
</ul>

<h2><a href="homework.html">Homework</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li> Read pages 68 - 73 of handout.  Hopefully this time through they will make more sense.  Start looking at the exercises at the end of the section.
</ul>
