<h1>Statistics 102H: Introduction</h1>
</center>
<p>

<h2>Work load</h2>
 On your own for first part of course
       <ul>
	 <li> practice jmp by yourself (or with a friend)
	 <li> Do the examples that I don't cover in class.
	 <li> make sure you understand both HOW to do the trick I do, and WHY I do them
	 <li> Project at end of first module
	 <li> midterm at end of first module
       </ul>
       Later we will turn to some mathematics, then I'll give more usual
       homeworks.
       <ul>
	 <li> I won't be monitoring your work--this is an honors
	      class, so you are on the honor system to keep up and
	      understand.
	 <li> Feel free to find other data and look at it. If you do
	      so, show it to me and we can discuss it.
       </ul>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Three parts:
       <ul>
	 <li> Prediction (via regression)
	 <li> Science and cause and effect (via ANOVA/two-sample/regression)
	 <li> Mathematical statistics
       </ul>
  <li> Third part will be most mathematical.  It will assume you have
       a good grasp of probabilistic models.  (Say 101H, 430, or other
       probabiltiy background.)
  <li> Prediction
       <ul>
	 <li> Goal is forecasting, not control
	 <li> Few assumptions--anything that works is legit
	 <li> Criterion: how good are the fits?
	 <li> Used in lots of science
	 <li> New ideas coming out of AI/machine learning in computer
	      science
       </ul>
  <li> Science / cause and effect 
       <ul>
	 <li> Where statistics started
	 <li> Correct attribution of blame
	 <li> Placebo, controled experiments, etc
	 <li> Exact same computing as prediction section--but new
	      intepretation and more assumptions.
	 <li> The real world creaps in here!
       </ul>
  <li> Mathematical statistics
       <ul>
	 <li> A bit of the math behind what we have been doing up to
	      this point
	 <li> Maximum likelihood estimator
       </ul>
</ul>
<h2>First example:cleaning crews (see book)</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Follow book: this is the prediction perspective
  <li> Science perspective: Would providing breaks improve work
       efficiency?
  <li> Mathematics perspective: Show MLE computation.
</ul>
