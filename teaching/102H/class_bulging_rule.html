<h1>Statistics 102H: Bulging rule and assumptions</h1>
</center>
<p>

<h2>Bulging rule</h2>

<h3>Finishing wine</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Compute equation and find maximum
  <li> Prediction: This is the prediction perspective
  <li> Science perspective: Maybe large shelf space is in large
       stores?  So changing shelf space doesn't change anything.  Need
       to read details of experiment/data. 
  <li> Mathematics perspective: Show MLE computation.
</ul>

<h3>Cell phones</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Introduce bulging rule
  <li> Current statistics: <a href="http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2002/BogusiaGrzywac.shtml">here</a>.
  <li> Looks like March 2002 = 180 Million?
</ul>

<h2>Assumptions</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Independence
  <li> Normality
  <li> Homoskadasticity
  <li> (see page 44-46)
</ul>
<h2>Checking assumptions</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Residuals approximately equal epsilons
  <li> make residuals in JMP
  <li> Look like a magnifying glass
</ul>

<h2>Isolated points</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Trouble or an anoynance?
  <li> deviations in Y direction = trouble (called outlier)
  <li> deviation in X direction  = anoynance (called high leverage)
  <li> BOTH = influential point = big trouble!
</ul>
<h2>Cottages</h2>
<ul>
  <li> important points might be leveraged
</ul>
<h1>To do at home</h1>
<ul>
  <li> Look at managing benifits (page 23)
       <ul>
	 <li> Can you use a transformation to fix this curvature?
	 <li> Try a few to convience yourself of your answer
	 <li> Follow the book in generating a polynomial fit
	 <li> Compute maximum cost point
       </ul>
  <li> Look at Crime (page 62) using JMP
  <li> Read Direct mail (page 72)
  <li> read introduction to class 3
</ul>
