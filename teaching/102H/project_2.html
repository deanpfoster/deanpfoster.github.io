<h1>Statistics 102H: Project 2</h1>
</center>
<p>

In this project you will work in groups of 2 or 3 people.  You will
design an experiment, collect and analyse the data and write
up a report.  I'm expecting most groups to do surveys of their fellow
students.  (Undergraduates are the single most surveyed group in the
world!)  If you want to go very far from the survey approach, talk to
me to soon for permission.
<p>
Sample ideas:
<ul>
  <li> Study wording of a question.  A famous example was: "Do you
       concievable or inconcievable that the holocaust did not
       occcur?"  VS. the question: "Do you believe the holocaust
       occured?"
  <li> Study order of questions.  Have two surveys with questions in
       different orders.
  <li> Will people give up a seat to a man or a woman more easilly?
       (Milgrom did some studies of this nature.)  Ask people for
       their seat at a table or on a bus.  What variables can you
       control that might change the response.
  <li> Taste tests:  Coke vs Pepsi would be the classic one.  Wine and
       Cheese are ones that I have personally run many times.  :-) One
       issues here is order often
       matters.  So a careful design treating order as a design
       variable can be very interesting.
  <li> Be creative.  What are decisions that you make while at Penn
       that you could test to see what the right answer is?
</ul>

<h2>Design (due April 2nd)</h2>

As you see from chapters 1 and 2, doing a randomized controlled
experiment will be much easier to analyse.  But, it will be harder to
collect the data.  Which design you choose will be up to you.  But
you will have to justify your decision in your report.

<p>
Answer the following questions (you can submit via email if you like):
<ul>
  <li> Target comparison.  What are you trying to learn?
       <ul>
	 <li> Do you have a control group?  If so, what is it?
	 <li> Are you randomizing?  If so, how?
       </ul>
  <li> How will you collect your subjects? 
       <ul>
	 <li> What is your target population?
	 <li> What is your sampled population?
       </ul>

  <li> First draft of your survey.  (Don't email word files.  Just cut
       and paste it into your email so that it comes in as ASCII.)
</ul>
When I get it, I'll comment, and you can then start collecting data.

<hr>
<h2>Data collection and analysis (due April 21st)</h2>

Generate the JMP output that your report will be based on.  Write a
paragraph giving a technical description of your favorite model.
You can think of this as being the technical appendix of your final
writeup.  
<ul>
  <li> Keep a copy yourself since you will want to base your final
       write up on the output you turn in here.
  <li> If you have any issues about what you should do in the data
       analysis, put them on the cover sheet and I'll email you a
       response.
  <li> Don't worry about being neat.  Feel free to annontate the
       output by hand.
  <li> My primary goal is to make sure you have a week of time to
       focus on writting up your report.  That is the most important
       part. 
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Write up (due April 28st)</h2>
Write up your report.
<ul>
  <li> Your report should have the following format:
       <ul>
	 <li> Abstract: A one paragraph summary of what you set out to
	      learn, and what you ended up finding.  It should
	      summarize the entire report.  (limit: 100 words max)
	 <li> Introduction: A discussion of why you collected the
	      data.  In other words, what you were trying to learn.
	      What have other people found in similar studies?  What
	      theories are you trying to disprove?
	 <li> Methods: Describe HOW you did the experiment.  I don't
	      need details.  But, I do need enough details that if I
	      were to xerox this section and give it to a group of 3
	      other students, they could reproduce your study.  The
	      goal is that they should be able to reproduce it
	      accurately enought that they get the same results that
	      you get.
	 <li> Results: Describe what you found.  This is the only
	      statistical part of the report.  :-)  
	 <li> Conclusions:  Tell me what were your scientific
	      conclusions.  What did we learn about the real world?
	      What are the regularities that we would expect to find
	      in future studies?
	 <li> Bibliography: Any paper you have cited should be listed
	      here. 
	 <li> Appendix: (optional) Other information that isn't important enough
	      to go in the body of the report but that you are
	      unwilling to throw away.  This might be the survey form
	      you used.  Or it might be some other statistical graphs
	      and tables that you didn't include.
       </ul>
  <li> Figures:  Any figures / tables you include should have a
       caption that is very descriptive of what the reader should
       learn.  There shouldn't be any need to read the paper to
       understand the figure.  If you can't think of a decient
       caption, then the figure should be cut from the
       report.
  <li> Statistical jargon: The point of this write up is to
       communicate the science of the problem NOT the statistics.  So
       avoid statistical jargon as much as possible.
  <li> Length: As short as possible!  Of course, you have to
       communicate the information in each section.
</ul>
