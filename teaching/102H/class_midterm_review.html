<p>

<h2>Administrivia</h2>

<ul>
  <li> I hope you have finished the sample exam.  Email me your answers, and I'll give
       you the correct back!  I'll post answers on tuesday morning for
people who are scared to tell me they finished the exam.
  <li> Let's move project due date to March 24th.  that way you can focus on your midterm. 
 </ul>



<h2>Studying for the Midterm</h2>
<ul>
  <li>  material you are responsable for:
       <ul>
	 <li> Chapters 1 - 8 in detail
	 <li> you should have read Chapter 9 (and understand the concept of multiple comparisons.) 
	 <li> You should have done all the homework assignments
       </ul>
  <li> Try to know WHY you should do something not HOW you do it
  <li> What do each of the following terms mean:
       <ul>
	 <li> p-value
	 <li> t-statistcis
	 <li> RMSE
	 <li> slope, intercept, coeficient
	 <li> colinearity
	 <li> hetroskadasticity
	 <li> outlier vs leverage vs influential point
       </ul>
  <li> Know your residuals!
       <ul>
	 <li> reread class 2.  It should make more sense now.
	 <li> Why do we want to check residuals?
	 <li> What do we do for each possible problem we run into?
       </ul>
</ul>
<h2>Looking at my project (questions from project)</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Look at my project and answer questions about material from that
  <li> Multiple comparisons and stepwise regression discussion
  <li> unit analysis: breakdowns/unit
  <li> Leveraged point: leverage on in units and leverage in 1/units
  <li> ploting residuals vs. left out variables (another use of a scatter plot matrix)
</ul>
