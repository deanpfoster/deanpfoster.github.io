<p>

<h2>Administrivia</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Start next project. You and your group will
       <ol>
	 <li> design an experiment
	 <li> collect the data
	 <li> analyse it
	 <li> write it up
       </ol>
  <li> Each of the above 4 steps will be individually turned in.
  <li> First step due next week.  
</ul>


<h2>Summary of course</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Studied so far: prediction
  <li> focusing on soon: causation and explanation
  <li> Business often deals with prediction, but science requires causation
</ul>

<h2>Chapter 1: controlled experiments</h2>

<h3>Comparisons</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Contrasts are easy to understand (men are taller than women)
  <li> Contrasts are useful for decisions (college educationed people
       make more money than non-college educated people.)
  <li> But are the comparisons fair?  
</ul>

<h3>Ideal experiment</h3>
<ul>
  <li> controled
  <li> randomized
  <li> double blind
</ul>

<h3>Why all that rigamarole? The story of the Polio vacine</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Case study: Polio vacine study
  <li> History:
       <ul>
	 <li> 50,000 per year
	 <li> cripeling disease
	 <li> Several proposed vacines
	 <li> Salk won.  Why?
       </ul>
  <li> Study designs
       <ul>
	 <li> NFIP: National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis
	 <li> Historical controls:
	      <ul>
		<li> vacinate all children and compare to last year
		<li> Oops: 1952=60k, 1953=30k, no vacine
		<li> Problem with epidemics
	      </ul>
	 <li> Treat all those who are willing
	      <ul>
		<li> Oops: willingness is correlated with income
		<li> Income is correlated with desease
		<li> Double oops: poor are healther in this case!
	      </ul>
	 <li> Treat grade 2, use grades 1 and 3 for controls (we'll
	      meet this again soon)
	 <li> Best: compare to randomized population
       </ul>
  <li> Implemented
       <ul>
	 <li> both 2 grade treatment and randomzied study
	 <li> See table from book for results
	 <li> Notice: the effect is VERY different
       </ul>
  <li> Placebo and double blinding
       <ul>
	 <li> Diagnosis is subjective (I've got a bad knee--polio or
	      not?) 
	 <li> patient reporting is subjective and may change actual
	      behavior 
       </ul>
</ul>
<h3>Portacaval shunt</h3>

Putting health people in treatment and the sick as controls.
<p>
So obviously wrong that why do we need to discuss it?  See the number
of studies that didn't do it!
<p>
Draw picture of flow of patients
<h3>
Other desease:
<ul>
  <li> Coronary bypass surgery:  What does placebo look like?
  <li> DES: "to prevent spontaneous abortion" actually caused cancer.
       Looked good on non-randomized trials.  Banned eventually.
</ul>
<h3>Ethics</h3>

Is using a placebo ethical?
<p>
Is doing a bad study ethical?
<p>
Is misleading doctors and patients ethical?

<hr>

<h2><a href="homework.html">Homework</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li> Read chapter 1 of FPP(A)
  <li> Start thinking about your second project (you can work in a
       group).  I'll put up some details soon after class.  
  <li> First step:
       <ul>
	 <li> Pick a group of 2 or three people
	 <li> Decide on something to study
	 <li> Can you do a controlled experiment?  If so do so.  If
	      not, be ready to defend your reasoning.
	 <li> Examples
	      <ul>
		<li> Does wording of a question effect the outcome?
		<li> Does order of question effect the outcome?
	      </ul>
       </ul>
</ul>
