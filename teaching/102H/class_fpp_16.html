<h2>Administrivia</h2>

<ul>
  <li> email me your first part of your project ASAP
  <li> turn back projects
  <li> Discuss homework: page 24.
  <li> I won't be here Wednesday.  (My 101.5 year old grandmother died
       this weekend.)  Chua will be filling in for me.
</ul>

<h2>Chapter 16: Law of averages</h2>

What the "Law of averages" is not:
<ul>
  <li> "number of heads approximately equals n/2"
  <li> No, that is too accurate
  <li> Look at graph on page 275
  <li> It keeps growing.
  <li> Sketch a log-log plot.  Helps handle large numbers
</ul>
Ok, then, what is it?
<ul>
  <li> "fraction of heads approximately equals 1/2"
  <li> This is easier to get right
  <li> Look at graph on page 276
  <li> Sketch a log-linear plot.  
</ul>
More exact form of law of averages is discussed in chapter 17 (Chua
will cover it next time).  Namely, what plot keeps it from dieing out
but also keeps it from going to infinity?  Answer is
(count-.5n)/sqrt(n).   But that is next time, and this is this time.
<p>
<h2>Abstraction: The box model</h2>
How can we generalize this to more interesting situations?
<ul>
  <li> lose the extras:
       <ul>
	 <li> Did you find subjects in the gym?
	 <li> What floor were they on?
	 <li> Did could the answer: tiard, exhusted, refreshed, etc
	 <li> Who where they?
	 <li> What where their names?
	 <li> How many were there in total?
       </ul>
  <li> Keep essentials:
       <ul>
	 <li> What numbers (exhausted=3)
	 <li> Frequency (oops hard to determine)
	 <li> total number of draws 
       </ul>
  <li> In other words: Think if putting tickets in a box
       <ul>
	 <li> what number to write on tickets?
	 <li> how many of each kind?
	 <li> how many draws?
       </ul>
  <li> Called box model.  Goal:  aproximate it as carefully as you
       can. 
</ul>
<h2>What about this box?</h2>

In science, the question is: which box are you drawing from?
<ul>
  <li> Target population = box you meant to draw from
  <li> sampled population = actual box
  <li> Tell a bit of chapter 19 stories
</ul>

<h3></h3>

<hr>

<h2><a href="homework.html">Homework</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li> Read chapter 16.  Read questions in back of chapter and think
       about them.
  <li> What is your box going to be?  Do you think you
       will actually hit that box?
</ul>
