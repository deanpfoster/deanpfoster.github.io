<center><h1>  Dean's 102H Statistics class: Spring 2003 </h1></center>

<p>

I made up a <a href="problem_set_for_final.pdf">handout</a> (<a
href="problem_set_for_final.ps">.ps</a>) to help guide you for the
final.  You can get the answers to the Freedman problems from outside
my door. The answers to the MLE questions are: (I did these in my
head--so I'm not positive they are correct.  If you disagree, send me
an email.)
<ul>
  <li> n/sum(log(x))
  <li> (n/sum log(x))^2
  <li> squareroot(sum(x^2)/2n)
</ul>


<h3>General information:</h3>
<UL>
  <li> Results of the first midterm:
       <ul>
	 <li> Oops: question 13 should be d not e on the key
	 <li> I'm going with 5 points per question.
	 <li> Median = 16.  IQR = 15 to 19.
	 <li> Mean = 16.5.  SD = 3.0
       </ul>
  <li> <a href="exam621.01.pdf">Sample midterm</a> (<a href="soln621.01.pdf">solutions</a>)
  <li> Background for the course: Next year 101H and 102H will be
       completely rewritten.  Next year 101H will cover basic
       statistics and 102H will cover regression.  So if you have
       already had a course in basic statistics (say AP stat) you
       would be best served waiting until next year.
       <p>
       But, if you have had a course in probability, then that is the
       background I'll be assuming.  (For example, 101H covered pure
       probability this year.)  I won't actually use this background
       till later in the semester.  So don't judge the course by what
       I'll cover in the first few classes.  If you don't have a
       strong probability background, stop by and talk to me to make
       sure you won't end up drowning.
  <li> Data can be gotten from <a href="http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~waterman/fsw/download.html">here</a>.

      grading and helping you with understand your projects.
      <ul>
