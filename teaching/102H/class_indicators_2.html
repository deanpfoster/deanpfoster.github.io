<ul>
  <li> How are rush and detail related to the average cost?
  <li> How are they related to each other?
  <li> Suppose that there is a cost for rush, but there isn't any cost
       for detail.  What would a simple regression of average cost on
       detail look like?  (Your data may actually show this, or it
       might not show it.  This doesn't matter.  Figure out what the
       relationship would be anyway!)
