<h2>Administrivia</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Turn in first part of your project (if you didn't email it).
  <li> be sure to include an email address on it!
  <li> I'm covering philosophy of testing.  Read book for details!  (You ARE responsible for details.) 
</ul>

<h2>Chapter 26: Tests of significance</h2>

<h3>Review:</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Box model for where our data comes from.
  <li> Average of sample is property of interest
  <li> Sample average (called X-bar) is close to population average (called mu)
  <li> How close? SE = SD/Sqrt(n) close.
  <li> In particular: (X-bar - mu)/SE has approximately a normal distribution
  <li> Here is where typical classes start looking stuff up in tables.  Instead, I'll have you memorize the table:
       <ul>
	 <li> P(Z <-3) = 1/1000
	 <li> P(Z <-2) = 1/40
	 <li> P(Z <-1) = 1/6
	 <li> P(Z < 0) = .5
	 <li> P(Z < 1) = 5/6
	 <li> P(Z < 2) = 39/40
	 <li> P(Z < 3) = .999
       </ul>
Lucky you!  (2/3, 19/20, 99.8 are the way I remimber them)
</ul>


<h3>Story time</h3>
Consider the following story of two opinions about an upcoming tax cut:
<ul>
  <li> New taxes: "revinue neutral" or not?
  <li> Draw 100 returns from previous years.  Recompute their tax payment.
  <li> X-bar = -$219.  SD = $725.
  <li> First conversation: SD vs SE.
  <li> Second conversation: test statistic: (mean - target)/SE = -3. corresponds to a 1/1000 chance of seeing a mean that far away from 0.  Yikes!
</ul>
Finally, we will be able to define:
<ul>
  <li> null hypothesis
  <li> alternative hypothesis
  <li> test statistic
  <li> p-value
</ul>

<h3>Null and alternative</h3>
Here the null was: the average in the box = $0.  The alternative the tresury worried about was that the average was less than zero.  (Tax payers might worry about another alternative.)
<p>
<em>Null claims that the observed difference are due to chance alone.  The alternative says the differences are real.
</em>
<h3>Test statistic</h3>
A test statistic measures the difference between the data and what is expected under then Null.
<p>
Typically: test statistic is normalized to look approximately normal.
<p>
P-value = observed significance level.
<p>
<em>P-value is chance of getting a test statistic this strange under then Null.  NOT, the chance of the null being correct!
</em>  (This difference should now be obvious to you.  If it isn't read the chapter carefully!)

<h3>Proofs and language</h3>
You can disprove the null
<ul>
  <li> Suppose p-value = 1/Million
  <li> Suppose you do another test and it is again 1/Million
  <li> Overall p-value = 1/Trillion
  <li> Do you think the null is still true?
</ul>
So we agree, you CAN disprove a null.
<p>
Can you prove a null true?
<ul>
  <li> you do a test and the p-value = .6
  <li> you do a test and the p-value = .2
  <li> you do a test and the p-value = .8
  <li> you do a test and the p-value = .5
  <li> you do a test and the p-value = .9
  <li> You combine all the data and the p-value = .3
  <li> Is the null true?  Suppose the total amount of data was small?
</ul>
All you can say is "I've failed to disprove the null."  This is very different than saying you have proven the null.  It could be a personal flaw, or it could be the null is true.  You will never know.
<h3>Example of putting it all together</h3>
Think, share, pair: Problem 11 on page 489.

<h2><a href="homework.html">Homework</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li> Read chapter 26.  In particular, read sections 5 - 8.  I didn't cover them, but you are responsable for them.
  <li> What will your test statistic be in your project?  (You might not be able to answer this yet if your project involves a regression)
</ul>
