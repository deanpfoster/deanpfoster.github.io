<h1>Statistics 102H: Predictions and CI</h1>
</center>
<p>


<h2>Basic "theory"</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Y = fit + noise
  <li> If everything goes well: relatively speaking fit has smaller variability
  <li> Prediction interval is based on SD of noise
  <li> Empirical rule:
       <ul>
	 <li> +/- 1 = 2/3s of data
	 <li> +/- 2 = 95% of data
	 <li> +/- 3 = 99.8% (ivory soap) of the data
       </ul>
  <li> What can go wrong?
       <ul>
	 <li> curvature
	 <li> non-independence
	 <li> hetroskadasticity
	 <li> non-normality
       </ul>
  <li> Hence checking assumptions is necessary to believe intervals
</ul>

<h2>Ignore fit inacuracy</h2>
<ul>
  <li> start by assuming alpha, beta, sigma are perfictly estimated
  <li> What is the guess for y for a new observation? (Y-hat = alpha-hat + beta-hat X.) 
  <li> Works if there is a lot of data
  <li> prediction intervals are basically flat
  <li> Try it with idealized regression? (Or use <a href="diamond.dat">diamond data</a>)
</ul>

       <h2>Homework</h2>
       <ul>
	 <li> Compute the solution to the least squares equation I
	      presented in class today.  In other words, find the
	      alpha and beta that minimize: <p>
Sum(Y<sub>i</sub> - alpha - beta X<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2</sup>
	 <li> You can start looking at the <a href="homework_1.html">first short assignment.</a> 
       </ul>
