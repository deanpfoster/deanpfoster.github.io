<h1>Statistics 102H: Executive compensation</h1>

<p>

<h2>Administrivia</h2>

<ul>
  <li> You should be well on your way to have your project data anaylsed
  <li> If you do all your regressions by friday, you can print your
       graphs and take them with you on your vacation.  (YEA!)
</ul>

Follow case book: page 202

<h2><a href="homework.html">Homework</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li> Work through the timing production runs case: page 189.
  <li> Notice, there are 4 or 5 managers in your project.
       <ul>
	 <li> Color code by manager
	 <li> Are there any obvious patterns when you look at your
	      scatter plot matrix?
	 <li> Are they significant when you put them in your project?
	      Which one is best, which one is worst?
	 <li> Are big jobs better to do by some manager instead of
	      some other manager?  (Hint: do the same interaction that
	      is done in the timing example.)
       </ul>
  <li> Well you are at it, notice that there is a strong relationship
       between manager and plant.  Why is this the case?  Does this
       change your feelings about how to compare the managers?
  <li> If you want to look at a sample midterm <a
       href="exam621.01.pdf">here</a> is an exam from 621.  It is
       close in style.  But they covered a bit more material than we
       will end up covering.  So some of the questions won't make
       sense.  (Questions 36-40 are on material we haven't covered.
       You might be able to do them, but don't worry if you can't.) 
</ul>
