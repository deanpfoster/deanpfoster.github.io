href="../../research/being_warren_buffett.pdf">being warren
buffett</a>" which was the content of the class before thanksgiving:
   <ol>
     <li> Suppose you are working with your grandmother on how she should
     allocate the money she has saved.  She is considering two
     investments, Tbill's which have a annual return of .03 and a
     variance of zero, and the market which she believes will have an
     annual return of .07 and a variance of .2<sup>2</sup>.  Suppose
     she is interested in maximizing her long run growth rate, then
     how should she allocate her money between t-bills and stocks?
     (Note: we are modeling her feelings of risk adversion by the fact
     that she expects the returns to be lower than the empircal
     average is.)
   <li> What is the optimal combination of Red, Green and White?  What
     will its long run growth rate be?  (Feel free to treat white as
     having zero mean and zero variance.)
   </ol>
