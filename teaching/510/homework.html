<h2> Practice questions for first midterm </h2>
<ul>
  <li> To see my style of writing exam questions, <a
href="midterm_2000.pdf">here</a> is an exam I wrote several years ago.
Here are the <a href="midterm_2000_answers.pdf">answers</a>.  (This
was a year where I taught out of Helms.)

<li> Last years <a href="midterm_2008.pdf">exam</a> and 
with <a href="midterm_2008_answers.pdf">answers</a>.  Note: the
students didn't like the multiple choice questions.  So I won't do as
many this year if at all. (This was a year where I taught out of Ross.)

<li> Since I'm not using either of the above books, here are some
problems that are like what I might have on the midterm: 
  <ul>
  <li> Section 1.2: 4, 9
  <li> Section 2.2: 2, 6, 8
  <li> Section 3.1: 17
  <li> Section 3.2: 19
  <li> Section 3.3:
   <ul>
     <li> In a 6 card deck, what is the fewest number of
shuffles that can convert $1,2,3,4,5,6$ to the sequence $2,4,5,1,3,6$?
What is the fewest number of unshuffles that could do this?
     <li> Suppose after doing three "Hindu shuffles" of a new deck a game of
solitare is played.  The probability of winning this game with a
perfectly shuffled deck is .3 but the probability of winning the game
with the hindu shuffled deck is .55.  What can we say about the
variation distance between these to distributions?
     </ul>
  <li> Section 4.1: 18, 29, 32 a,b (you did these already--but the
style is just so easy to write exams questions about that you should
make sure you still know how to do them.), 43 (This is easier than it
looks.  Assume that baseball is SOOOOOOOO borring that even the
umpires have fallen asleep.  So they for get to call an end to the
series.  They end up playing all 7 games even if someone was ahead
before the 7th game.  What is the probability of the Yankees winning
in this version?  Does it matter?  This trick is important enough that
it might appear on an exam sometime in your future!  It is called
"coupling" in probability theory.)
  <li> Section 4.2: 7
  <li> Section 4.3:  Consider three-prisoner's, two of three prisoners
a, b, and c are chosen at random to be executed, Prissoner a asks the
jailer whether b or c will be executed The jailer says b.  So now
either a or c will go free.  What is the probability that a will be
executed now? 
  <li> I won't suggest ones from chapter 5 since you already are doing
some for homework.
  </ul>
</ul>

<!-- Have a homework due after midterm.   -->


<h2>Homework 7</h2>
<a name="seven">
<ul>
  <li> Read Chapter 6.1.
  <li> 6.1 p 247:  1, 6, 12, 13, 14, 19
  <li> Read the chapter from Whittle <em>Probability via Expectation</em>
  <li> Problems from the handout:
  <ul>
     <li> page 83: 3 (NOTE: this has a bad definition for
b<sub>j</sub>.  It should be P(X = j|X > j-1).  So the equation also
changes to be b<sub>j</sub> = p<sub>j</sub>/(sum p<sub>k</sub>) where
the sum is over k > j-1.)
     <li> page 91: 2, 3 (NOTE: there is nothing to do for problem 2.
Just read it and then do problem 3.)
     <li> page 96: 1
     <li> page 87: (bonus) 5
  </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Homework 8</h2>
<a name="eight">
<ul>
  <li> Read Chapter 6.2 and 6.3.  (Read carefully all but pages 275,
276 and 277.)
  <li> 6.2 page 263: 4, 8, 12, 15, 21, 22, 30 (note: 30 is number #29
in the electronic version.  The question asks what is the variance of
a poisson random variable.)
  <li> 6.3 page 277: 1, 7, 14, 17, 18
  <li> (bonus) Wittle, p 92 #4.
  </ul>
</ul>


<h2>Homework 9</h2>
<a name="nine">
<ul>
  <li> Read Chapter 7 for the homework
  <li> Read Chapter 8 before I lecture on it.
  <li> 7.1: 1, 5, 7, 10
  <li> 7.2: 2, 6, 10, 14, 15, 19
  <li> (bonus): 7.2: 7
</ul>

<h2>Homework 10</h2>
<a name="ten">
<ul>
  <li> Reread chapter 8.  This is hard stuff.  Make sure you know it
cold!
  <li> Plotting exercise:
     <ul>
     <li> Read in this  <a href="law_of_large_numbers.txt">dataset</a>.
     <li> Do a plot of the average minus the mean vs the number of
samples.  Does it seem to be 
converging?  If so, to where?  Do a plot of the large samples
sizes--namely those greater than 1000.
Now the really large samples sizes, say bigger than 1 million.  Now
bigger than 1 trillion.  Now 
bigger than 10<sup>50</sup>.  In what way do these look the same/different?
(NOTE: good software will keep rescaling the y-axis to make it full
screen.  If that doesn't happen, you will have to do that yourself.)
     <li> Transform both Xbar and time by "arc tan."  Now plot the
data again.  Mark where n=100 appears.  Mark where n=1000 appears on
your graph.  Where infinity on your graph?
     <li> Select out the sample sizes for which Xbar is bigger than zero.  Now we
can take logs without breaking mathematics rules.  Do a plot of
log(Xbar) vs log(sample size).  What is the slope of this plot?  Can you
relate this slope to the sqrt(n) law given in class?
     <li> (bonus) Look at the wiki page on the law of the iterated logorithm.
See if you can reproduce the plot that I made for them.
     </ul>
  <li> chapter 8.1: 4, 6, 8, 10
  <li> chapter 8.2: 1, 4, 8,
  <li> chapter 8.2: 16 (For this one problem, try to create pictures that look
like the "plotting exercise" above.  You don't need to create all the
pictures since the plot won't look similar.  You won't easilly compute
as long a run as I did unless you think of some cool tricks.)
</ul>

<h2>Homework 11</h2>
<a name="eleven">
<ul>
  <li> read chapter 9.
  <li> chapter 9.1: 4, 9, 18
  <li> chapter 9.2: 1, 3, 9, 11
  <li> chapter 9.3: 3, 11, 12
  <li> Bonus questions based on "<a
href="../../research/being_warren_buffett.pdf">being warren
buffett</a>" which was the content of the class before thanksgiving:
   <ol>
     <li> Suppose you are working with your grandmother on how she should
     allocate the money she has saved.  She is considering two
     investments, Tbill's which have a annual return of .03 and a
     variance of zero, and the market which she believes will have an
     annual return of .07 and a variance of .2<sup>2</sup>.  Suppose
     she is interested in maximizing her long run growth rate, then
     how should she allocate her money between t-bills and stocks?
     (Note: we are modeling her feelings of risk adversion by the fact
     that she expects the returns to be lower than the empircal
     average is.)
   <li> What is the optimal combination of Red, Green and White?  What
     will its long run growth rate be?  (Feel free to treat white as
     having zero mean and zero variance.)
   </ol>
</ul>

<h2>Homework 12</h2>
<a name="twelve">
<ul>
  <li> Read chapter 10.
  <li> Chapter 10.1: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8
  <li> Chapter 10.2: 2, 4
  <li> Bonus: 10.2: 8
</ul>

<h2>Review questions for exam</h2>
<a name="final">
<ul>
  <li> Here is a practice final: <a href="final.pdf">exam</a>, (<a href="final_with_answers.pdf">answers</a>)
  <li> ch6: 1.13, 1.27 (first part), 1.37, 2.15, 2.23, 3.7, 3.15
(too hard without guidance for the exam)
  <li> ch7: 1.3, 2.3
  <li> ch8: 1.5, 2.3, 3.5
  <li> ch9: not selected yet
  <li> ch10: not selected yet
  <li> reread Wittle
