<h2> Practice questions for first midterm </h2>
<ul>
  <li> To see my style of writing exam questions, <a
href="midterm_2000.pdf">here</a> is an exam I wrote several years ago.
Here are the <a href="midterm_2000_answers.pdf">answers</a>.  (This
was a year where I taught out of Helms.)

<li> Last years <a href="midterm_2008.pdf">exam</a> and 
with <a href="midterm_2008_answers.pdf">answers</a>.  Note: the
students didn't like the multiple choice questions.  So I won't do as
many this year if at all. (This was a year where I taught out of Ross.)

<li> Since I'm not using either of the above books, here are some
problems that are like what I might have on the midterm: 
  <ul>
  <li> Section 1.2: 4, 9
  <li> Section 2.2: 2, 6, 8
  <li> Section 3.1: 17
  <li> Section 3.2: 19
  <li> Section 3.3:
   <ul>
     <li> In a 6 card deck, what is the fewest number of
shuffles that can convert $1,2,3,4,5,6$ to the sequence $2,4,5,1,3,6$?
What is the fewest number of unshuffles that could do this?
     <li> Suppose after doing three "Hindu shuffles" of a new deck a game of
solitare is played.  The probability of winning this game with a
perfectly shuffled deck is .3 but the probability of winning the game
with the hindu shuffled deck is .55.  What can we say about the
variation distance between these to distributions?
     </ul>
  <li> Section 4.1: 18, 29, 32 a,b (you did these already--but the
style is just so easy to write exams questions about that you should
make sure you still know how to do them.), 43 (This is easier than it
looks.  Assume that baseball is SOOOOOOOO borring that even the
umpires have fallen asleep.  So they for get to call an end to the
series.  They end up playing all 7 games even if someone was ahead
before the 7th game.  What is the probability of the Yankees winning
in this version?  Does it matter?  This trick is important enough that
it might appear on an exam sometime in your future!  It is called
"coupling" in probability theory.)
  <li> Section 4.2: 7
  <li> Section 4.3:  Consider three-prisoner's, two of three prisoners
a, b, and c are chosen at random to be executed, Prissoner a asks the
jailer whether b or c will be executed The jailer says b.  So now
either a or c will go free.  What is the probability that a will be
executed now? 
  <li> I won't suggest ones from chapter 5 since you already are doing
some for homework.
  </ul>
</ul>

<!-- Have a homework due after midterm.   -->


<h2>Homework 7</h2>
<a name="seven">
<ul>
  <li> Read Chapter 6.1.
  <li> 6.1 p 247:  1, 6, 12, 13, 14, 19
  <li> Read the chapter from Whittle <em>Probability via Expectation</em>
  <li> Problems from the handout:
  <ul>
     <li> page 83: 3 (NOTE: this has a bad definition for
b<sub>j</sub>.  It should be P(X = j|X > j-1).  So the equation also
changes to be b<sub>j</sub> = p<sub>j</sub>/(sum p<sub>k</sub>) where
the sum is over k > j-1.)
     <li> page 91: 2, 3 (NOTE: there is nothing to do for problem 2.
Just read it and then do problem 3.)
     <li> page 96: 1
     <li> page 87: (bonus) 5
  </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Homework 8</h2>
<a name="eight">
<h2>Homework 9</h2>
<a name="nine">
<h2>Homework 10</h2>
<a name="ten">

<h2>Homework 11</h2>
<a name="eleven">
<ul>
  <li> Bonus questions based on "<a
href="../../research/being_warren_buffett.pdf">being warren
buffett</a>" which was the content of the class before thanksgiving:
   <ol>
     <li> Suppose you are working with your grandmother on how she should
     allocate the money she has saved.  She is considering two
     investments, Tbill's which have a annual return of .03 and a
     variance of zero, and the market which she believes will have an
     annual return of .07 and a variance of .2<sup>2</sup>.  Suppose
     she is interested in maximizing her long run growth rate, then
     how should she allocate her money between t-bills and stocks?
     (Note: we are modeling her feelings of risk adversion by the fact
     that she expects the returns to be lower than the empircal
     average is.)
   <li> What is the optimal combination of Red, Green and White?  What
     will its long run growth rate be?  (Feel free to treat white as
     having zero mean and zero variance.)
   </ol>
</ul>
