<h3><a href="homework.html">Homework</a></h3>
<h3><a href="schedule.html">Schedule and readings</a></h3>

You have to do the problems to understand the concepts.  There will
be about 11 - 13 homeworks.  Current research suggests you are your
own best judge of what you are learning.  So I'll have a grader
correct your homeworks, but not score them.  

<h3><a href="notes.html">Teaching notes</a></h3>
I've put up the teaching notes that I use to remind me what I'm
covering.  If you find these useful, let me know and I'll link the
schedule to them to make them easier to find and put them up as I
write them.
