<center><h1>  Statistics 510 (aka Stat 430H) </h1></center>

<h3><a href="homework.html">Homework</a></h3>
<h3><a href="schedule.html">Schedule and readings</a></h3>

This is a problems based course.  You have to do the problems to
understand the concepts.  There will be about 11 - 13 collected homeworks
(and a few that won't be collected).

<h3><a href="notes.html">Teaching notes</a></h3>
I've put up the teaching notes that I use to remind me what I'm
covering.  If you find these useful, let me know and I'll link the
schedule to them to make them easier to find and put them up as I
write them.
