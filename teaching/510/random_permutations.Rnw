\section*{Story and puzzle}

\begin{itemize}
\item 100 prisoners
\item names in 100 Jars
\item Must find their own name
\item Can look in up to 50 of the 100 jars
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Bounds}
\begin{itemize}
\item Personal success: 50 percent
\item So, call $A_1, \cdots, A_{n}$ each person being personally success
\item Goal: min $E\prod A_i$
\item Bounds: $W = \prod A_i$
\begin{itemize}
\item $EW \ge 0$
\item $EW \le EA_1 = .5$
\item By independent behaviour we can make $EW = 2^{-n}$.
\item If $A$'s were correlated, we could do better
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section*{What is a random permutations?}

\section*{Some questions to ask:}

\begin{itemize}
\item Largest ``Comb'' i.e. an increasing subsequence
\item Probability of one long cycle
\item longest cycle: is about .624329988... $n$ (called the
Golomb-Dickman constant.  Also about the size of the largest prime factor.)
\item probability of being a derangement
\item number of fixed points
\end{itemize}

\section*{Fixed points /  Hats}
Inclusion exclusion on fixed points

\item
