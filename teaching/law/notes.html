<h2>Outline of key points:</h2>

<h3>Background:</h3>

During 1980's about 30% of the young doctors were women (where young
means under 45) and only 10-15% of the older doctors were women.  See:
<p>
<a
href="http://www.cis.org/articles/1998/DocsandNurses.html#table3.1">historical
data</a>
<p>
Contrast this with ARCOM who has managed to attract enough women to
make up over 50% of all its young doctors (those with under 10 years
experience).  Even historically, ARCOM has hired well in the sense
that it has about 25% of its older doctors being women.  So its hiring
practice seems to be attractive enough to women to attract almost
twice the typical number.

<li>
(1) But have these women been given comparable pay increases since
they were hired?
<li>
(2) Were they hired at equivalent salaries?
<li>
(3) Is there other evidence of pay discrimination?
<li>
(4) Is there promotion or hiring bias?
</ol>
<p>
NOTE: They can't argue point 2 since there is no data on it.  So
innocent until proven guilty?)
<h3>Analysis in jmp</h3>

I'm working in jmp.  <a href="nussbaum.JMP">Here</a> is the data in
that format.

<p>
<h3>Pay increase: (<a href="dollar_increase">in dollars</a>, <a
href="percent_increase">in percent</a>)</h3>
<p>
In 1985, Women were given pay increase that were $5513 less than men
got.  But, when controlling for field and experience women got pay
raises within $200 of those of men.  (In fact women were given larger
increases when controling for field and experience.)  These numbers
aren't statistically meaningful due to issues of hetroscadasticity.
<p>
Using percentages, is better statistics.  Raises were mostly between
5% and 14%.  But, they were typically about .2% lower for women than
for men (2*.1% se=.12).  When controling for field, this is left
basically unchanged (2 * .1%, se=.13).  When years of experience is
also controlled for, this stays statistically insignificant at .26% (2
* .13 se=.13).
<p>
So, it appears that over the year 84-85 there wasn't statistically
significant differerence between the raises given to women and those
given to men.
<p>
<h3>Current salary (<a href="log_sal_85_with_point">log sal</a>, <a
href="log_sal_85_without_point">outlier removed</a>)</h3>
<p>
If there was a history of pay increase discrimination it might show up
by having current pay be lower for women than men.  Unfortunately,
lots of other things can show up here also: years experience, field,
previous discrimination done by the educational system of the 1950's,
etc.  So care will have to be taken to tease out these other effects.
<p>
Across the entire school women are paid about 40% less (2*19%, se=3%).
So it is obvious that women and men are different.  We didn't need
regression to determine this fact though.
<p>
We will look at three sources of this pay difference: field of choice,
years of experience and sex.
<p>
The most important of these three is the field each person chooses to
enter.  When this is controlled for the pay difference drops down to
20% (10.2% se=1.7%).  Notice that the hospital pays surgeons twice the
average (73%, se=3%), pediatrics about par (-4%, se=4%) and doctors in
physiology almost 1/2 of typical (-48%, se=3.7%)
<p>
When years of experience is controled for, the pay difference for
women is about 7% (2*3.4% se=1.7%).  Obviously if we controlled for
different things this number would keep changing.  Rather than try
every possibility, let's work with an analogy.
<p>
"Publish or perish."  Its the montra of academia.  But if you look for
how much a paper affects your pay, it doesn't look like publishing is
a good thing.  Writing one more paper per year lowers your pay by 4%
(4.4%, se=1%, controling for experience and field).  But still most of
the doctors write about 4 papers a year?  Why are they cutting their
salary by almost 20%?  
<p>
Papers are a proxy for the type of medicine you do.  It is a proxy for
what you find interesting in life.  
<p>
This data doesn't prove that women are getting 7% less pay than men
are any more than it proves that publishing a paper decreases ones
pay.  Since both effects are statistically small, it is easy to
believe that something else is the source of what is going on.
<p>
<h3>Personal expertise:</h3>

I have done <a href="../research">research</a> on the importance of
affirmative action (see ``An Economic Argument for Affirmative
Action,'' with R.  Vohra, Rationality and Society, (1992), 176 - 188,
with discussion by G. Loury, by D.  Friedman, and by J. Heckman and
T. Philipson.)

<p>

I will be using multiple regression for purposes of analysis.  For the
past 15 years I've been an expert on multiple regression.  (See ``The
Risk Inflation Criterion for Multiple Regression,'' with E.  George,
The Annals of Statistics, (1994), 1947 - 1975.)  Multiple regression
is the primary tool for investigating these sort of problems.
