<h1>Data used by the defense's expert</h1>

<ul>
<li>
In case "discovery" can be done in .html the file is at <br>
http://gosset.wharton.upenn.edu/~foster/law/
<li> <a href="case.html">Description of case</a>
<li> Data file: <a href="nussbaum.JMP">.jmp</a>
<li> priliminary analysis: <a href="background_statistics">marginals</a>
<li> Women have many covariates that correlate with <a href="simple_regressions">lower income </a>
<li> Pay increase seem fair in both dollar and percentage: <a href="dollar_increase">in dollars</a>, <a
href="percent_increase">in percent</a>
<li> <a href="equal_experience_equal_pay">women have less experience
for given pay</a>
<p>
Pay should equal work.  We have an accurate measure of total payment,
namely income.  We only have proxies for quality and quantity of
work (experience, publications, etc).  Regression assumes that Y =
f(x) + noise.  Thus, the variable that has the error in its
measurement should be the Y variable.  In this case, our estimate of
work is much worse than our estimate of pay.  So, the best test of
equality is to put experience as the Y (dependent variable)  and Pay
as the X (independent variable).  THen if the indicator for women
shows that they have to "work harder" for the same pay, that would be
evidence of discrimination.  This doesn't appear to be the case.
<p>
Even if field is corrected for, there is still no evidence of
discrimination.  (Notice the t-ratio is -22).  The final graph makes
this clear as a picture.  (Notice that women almost uniformaly have
lower experience than men for a given pay.)


<li> My guess as to Plaintif's regression model: <a
href="log_sal_85_with_point">log</a>, <a
href="log_sal_85_without_point">log withoutlier removed</a>
<p>
But, what if rank is <a href="with_rank">included?</a>  The
t-statistic is insignficant.
