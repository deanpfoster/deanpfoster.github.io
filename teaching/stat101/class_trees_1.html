     <p>
     P(success) = .6,  P(+ test|success) = .8, P(+ test|failure) =
     .4.
     </p>
     <ul>
       <li> E(profits without test) = 4*.6 - 2.5*.4 = 1.4 million
       <li> E(profits perfect info) = 4*.6 = 2.4 million
       <li> Value of perfect information = 1 million.
       <li> E(profits with test) = (draw tree) = .12 Million
       <li> Value of sample information
     </ul>
     </p>
<li> Does it always pay to do a test for a product launch?
