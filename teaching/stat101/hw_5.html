<LI>The time it takes to complete a project, Y, has a mean of 16 months and a standard deviation of 4 months. The following two quantities are of interest:
</p>
<OL TYPE="i">

<LI>The probability, P, that the project will be done in less than one year.</LI>
<LI>The time, T, such that there is only a 10% chance that the project will take more than T months.</LI>
</OL>
</p>
<OL TYPE="a">

<LI>Find P and T assuming that Y is uniformly distributed with the above mean and 
    standard deviation.

<LI>Find P and T assuming that Y is exponentially distributed with the above mean.
<li>
Find P and T assuming that Y is normally distributed with the above mean and
     standard deviation.</P>

<LI>The number of cars that arrive at the toll booths on the Benjamin Franklin Bridge 
     during evening rush hour (i.e., between 5 and 6PM) has a Poisson distribution with
      mean of 400 cars.</P>
<OL TYPE="a">
<LI>Write an expression (do not calculate) for the probability that there will be more than 
     450 cars on a day between 5 and 6PM.

<LI>Find a suitable approximation to the probability in a).

<li>Write an expression (do not calculate) for the probability that
     there will be more than 10 days in a year (260 weekdays) with
     fewer than 360 cars during 5-6PM.  Note: You may assume that the
     probability is .02 that there will be fewer than 360 cars during
     any evening rush hour. 

<LI>What assumption(s) did you make in answering c)? Are the
     assumptions reasonable?</LI> 
<LI>Find an approximation to the probability in c) using the Poisson
     distribution.</LI> 
<LI>Find an approximation to the probability in c) using the Normal
     distribution.
