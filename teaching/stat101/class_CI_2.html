<h2>Confidence intervals for binomials</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Gallup Poll: Forecast the presidential outcome
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Not good enough to merely pick the winner.
         <li> The actual fraction is important also.
         <li> CI = p +/- 1.96 sqrt(p(1-p)/n)
       </ul>
       </p>
   <li> Literary Digest (Roosevelt vs Landon, 1936)
       <p>
       <ul>
         <li> Largest opinion poll ever taken: 2.4 million
         <li> LD had been correct in every electin shince 1916
	 <li> Predicted Roosevelt would get 42%
         <li> CI = 42% +/- .0006
         <li> Actual answer 62% for Roosevelt
         <li> sampling list came from: club membership lists, phone
              books (1/4 had phones)
         <li> Called "Selection bias"
         <li> Gallup predicted results using 50,000 people
       </p>
       </ul>
    <li> Typical current Gallup polls (see overhead)
        </p>
    <li> Problem: hard to find voters
</ul>
<h2>Confidence intervals for small samples</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Problem: Manufacture good beer
    </P>
  <li> Solution: sample beer for various chemicals to see if it is done yet
    </p>
  <li> Difficulty: don't want to drink up all the beer!
    </p>
  <li> Solution: only take two observations
</p>
  <li> See <a href="beer.jmp">beer.jmp</a>
</p>
  <li> Suppose we want 99.8% accuracy, so we use +/- 3 SE's
</p>
  <li> What happens?  Try it in JMP.
