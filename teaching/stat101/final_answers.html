<ol>


<li>
<ol type = A>
<li> F(x) = 1 - e<sup>-x/10</sup>.  We want P(X > 15) = 1 - F(15) = 1
- (1 -  e<sup>-15/10</sup>) =  e<sup>-1.5</sup> = .22.
</p>
<li> Note: E(X) = 10, SD(X) = 10
<p>
<ol type = i>
<li> E(Y) = 10,000 x 10 = 100,000 KWH
<li> SD(Y) = sqrt(10,000) x SD(X) = 1000 KWH
<li> P(Y > 102000 KWH) =  P((Y-100000)/100 > (102000-100000)/1000) = P(Z >
2) = .025 or more accurately .0228
</ol>
</p>
<li> P(Y > y) = P(Z > (y - 100000)/1000).  But we can figure out that
P(Z > 2.33) = .01.  So, (y - 100000)/1000 = 2.33.  Y = 102330
KWH.
</ol>




<li>
<ol type = A>
	<li> (a) increasing the confidence would make the interval
wider.  Thus to keep it from getting wider, more data must be
collected.
</p>
	<li> (b) The estimate will be biased downward because the
previous months are lower than the current month.
</p>
	<li> (b)
</p>
	<li> (c) .1 +/- 1.96 sqrt(.1 x .9/100) = .1 +/- .0588
</p>
	<li> (c) SE = .01.  And SE < sqrt(.15 x .85/n).  So n =
.15 x .85/(.1)<sup>2</sup> = 1275.  If you use 1.96 instead of 2, you
get the exact answer (i.e. start with SE = .02/1.96 instead of SE = .01).
</ol>
</p>



<li>
<ol type = A>
<li> With a sample of 100, we can use either the normal distribution
or the t-distribution.  The SE = 2/sqrt(100) = .2 minutes.  Thus, the
confidence interval is 10.5 +/- (1.96) x .2 = [10.1,10.9].  since 10 is
not in the confidence interval, it doesn't seem resonable that the
mean equals 10.
</p>
<li> We want SE = 1/10 minute.  But, SE = 2/sqrt(n).  So, 1/10 =
2/sqrt(n), so n should be 400.  (Again, more accuracy is generate by
1.96<sup>2</sup>  2<sup>2</sup> / (1/5)<sup>2</sup>
</p>
<li> P(X > 12) = P((X - 10)/2 > (12 - 10)/2) = P(Z > 1).  From the
empirical rule we guess that this probability should be about 1/6.
Using H&O's tables, we get an exact answer of .5 - .3413 = .1587.
<p>
Let N be the number that are greater than 12 out of the 100 sampled
items.  Then N is a binomial with pi = .1587 and n = 100.  Using H&O
page 797 we can approximate this by the pi = .15 column which give an
answer of .0402 + .0270 + .0171 + .0103 + ... = .09.
<p>
Or we can use the fact that N is approximately a normal with a mean of
15.87 ( = n x pi) and a standard deviation of 3.65 = sqrt(n x pi x (1-pi)).
So, P(N >= 20) = P(Z >= 1.15) = .5 - .3749 = .1251.  Unfortunately, we
also could do the calculation as P(N >= 20) = P(N > 19) = P(Z > .85) =
.5 - .3023 = .2977.
</p>
<li> Control limits are 9 to 11.  (10 +/- 2 x 2/sqrt(16))
</p>
<li> About 50%.
</ol>
<li>
<ol type = A>
<li>
<ol type = i>
<li> Let X be the first estimator.  P(X = 11) = P(X = 13) = P(X = 17)
= P(X = 19) = 1/4.
<li> by symetry it is unbiased.
<li> SD  = 4<sup>2</sup> x .25 + 2<sup>2</sup> x .25 + 2<sup>2</sup> x .25 + 4<sup>2</sup> x .25 = 10
</ol>
<li> 
<ol type = i>
<li> Let Y be the second estimator.  P(Y = 12) = 1/4, P(Y = 15) = 1/2,
P(Y = 18) = 1/4.
<li> by symmetry it is unbiased.
<li> SD = 3<sup>2</sup> x .25 + 0<sup>2</sup> x .25 + 0<sup>2</sup> x .25 + 3<sup>2</sup> x .25  = 4.5

</ol>
</p>
<li> the second estimator has a lower standard deviation.  
</ul>



<li>
<ol type = A>
<li> Y-bar is very skewed.  The tail is much longer in the "large
values" direction than in the small values direction.
<p>
<li> Y-bar: Yes, a CI for its mean owuld be 100 +/- 3.6.  So 100 is quite
likely the correct mean.  <p>
Complex: Yes. Similar story.
<p>
<li> The "complex" estimator has a much smaller standard deviation
than Y-bar has.  So it is the better estimator.
</ol>

<li> <ol type = A> <li> The average is about 57 degrees.  The standard
deviation is about .2 degrees.  <p> <li> The temperature has been
increasing.  It starts out significantly smaller than the average and
ends up significantly larger than the average.  It doesn't appear that
the process is in control.
</ol>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5A) Most got the right. A few said yes, but also emphasised that it 
was skewed in which case they lost 1 or 3 points depending on their argument.

5B) above

5C) Most argued better sd.  If they also argued complex "more normal 
looking" I took off a point since the test states the distribution is 
lognormal and so using a normal appearance is an incorrect criterion.

6A) Everyone had the mean correct.  I accepted .189 or .194 for the sd.  
If they got the sd wrong, I subtracted two (+2 for the mean and +1 
partial credit for the sd).

6B) I graded this pretty easy.   I gave full credit if they had temp 
increased significantly and/or out of control.
