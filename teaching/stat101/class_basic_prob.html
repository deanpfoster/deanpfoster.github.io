<center><h1>  Statistics 101: Basic probability</h1></center>

<UL>
<li> Administrivia: 
<p>
   <ul>
   <li> The solutions will appear on the web on Thursday afternoon
   </ul>
</p>
<li> Example: Cats and dogs
<p>
   <ul>
   <li> Raise your hand if you had cats and dogs as pets growing up?
   <li> Raise your hand if you had cats or dogs as pets growing up?
   <li> This is the way to think about intersection ("and") and union ("or")
   <li> Make Venn diagram
   </ul>
</p>

<li> Three types of probability: 
<p>
   <ul>
   <li> counting (e.g. cards, coins and dice)
   <li> Psychological or subjective (e.g. horse track betting)
   <li> long run frequency (e.g. science)
   </ul>
</p>
<li> All three types follow these rules:
<p> 
   <ul>
   <li> 0 &lt= P(A) &lt= 1
   <li> P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) if A and B are mutually exclusive
   <li> P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
   <li> P(A) = 1 - P(not A)
   <li> P(A|B) = P(A and B)/P(B)
   </ul>
<p>
<li> Probabilities can often be represented as tables (did diferent example in class)
<p>
<center>
<table border>
<TR> <TH>                     <TH> Male <TH> Female <TH> total </TR>
<TR> <TH> Taller than 6 foot  <TD> .2   <TD> .05    <TD> .25   </tr>
<TR> <TH> Shorter than 6 foot <TD> .3   <TD> .45    <TD> .75   </tr>
<TR> <TH> Total               <TD> .5   <TD> .5     <TD> 1.00 </tr>
</table>
</center>
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
  <li> It is easy to read off P(Taller|Male) from chart (e.g. .2/.5)
  <li> Probabilities written in the margins of table are called marginal probabilities
  </ul>
</p>
<li> Independence (section 3.2)
<p>
    <ul>
    <li> definition of independence: P(A) = P(A|B)
    <li> Alternative definition: P(A and B) = P(A)P(B)
    <li> What we do intuitively
    <li> Note: height and sex are not independent in above example
    </ul>
</ul>
