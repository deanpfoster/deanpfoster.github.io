<li> Show: If A is not independent of B then A complement is not independent of
      B complement
</p>
<li> Two tennis players A and B play two tennis matches against each other. The
      probability that A wins the first match is .5. The probability that A wins the second
      match is also .5. But the probability that A wins the second match given A wins the
      first match is .6. What is the probability that player A wins at least one match?

<LI> Three marksmen A, B, and C engage in a contest. The marksmen who is alive last   
      wins 1 million dollars. Each marksman gets to shoot in turn at one of the other two
     marksmen (i.e., A can shoot at B or C; B at A or C; C at A or B). Each marksman
     has two bullets. A has a .3 chance of hitting a target, B has a .5 chance, and C always
     hits the target. They go sequentially, with A going first, B second (if he is still alive),
     C third (if he still alive), then back to A, B, and finally C. At any point a marksman
     can throw his bullet away (i.e., shoot in the air). If more than one marksman is alive
     then no one wins.
</P>
<OL TYPE="a">
<LI>Show that it is best for A to throw his first bullet away.
</p>
<LI>Find the optimal strategy for each marksman to maximize the probability of 
winning the 1 million dollars.
</p>
<LI> If all of the marksmen follow optimal strategies, what are the probabilities that A,
B, and C win?

<li> You go to Atlantic City with $32. You decide to play roulette and always bet on Red.
     Note that the true probability of Red is 18/38, but assume it is ½ to simplify the
     calculations.
<OL TYPE="a">
<p>
     Strategy 1: You bet $8 on Red on four consecutive rolls. Let Y<SUB>1 </SUB>= amount you go
      home with under strategy 1.</P>
</p>
<LI>Find the discrete probability distribution and cumulative distribution function for Y<SUB>1 </SUB>.
</LI>

<p>Strategy 2: You bet $1 on Red on the first roll. If you win you go home. If you lose,
you bet $2 on Red on the second roll. If you win you go home. If you lose, you bet
$4 on Red on the third roll. If you win you go home. If you lose, you bet $8 on Red
on the fourth roll. If you win you go home. If you lose, you make one more bet of
$16 on Red on the fifth roll. You go home after the fifth roll.
</p>

<LI>Find the discrete probability distribution and cumulative distribution function for Y<SUB>2</SUB> .
</LI>
<LI>Devise two criteria for comparing the above two strategies and indicate which 
Strategy is best for each of the criterions.
