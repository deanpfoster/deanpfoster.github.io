<center><h1>Discrete distributions (cont'd)</h1></center>

<ul>
  <li> Admistrivia:
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Passout answer to sample midterms
	 <li> Monday will be a review.  Bring questions and problems.
	 <li> Reminder of extra office hours

<h2>Sums of Binomials</h2>

 Sum of binomials is binomial:
       <p>
       Eg. X,Y are binomial, pi = 3/4, n = 5 
       <p>
       Z = X + Y
       <p>
       Z is binomial pi = 3/4, n = 10
  <li> Easiest binomial is n = 1: mean = pi, var = pi(1 - pi)
  <li> Binomial: mean = n(pi), var = n(pi)(1-pi)


<h2>Sums of Poisson</h2>
 Sum of poisson is poisson:
       <p>
       Eg. X = number males entering a bank, Y = number of females
       mu for males = 40, mu for females = 50
       <p>
       Z = X + Y
       <p>
       Z is Poisson mu 90

<h2>Discuss means and variances of each type</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Binomial: mean = n(pi), var = n(pi)(1-pi)
       </p>
  <li> Hypergeometric: mean = n(pi)(1-pi), var = n(pi)(1 - pi) (N-n)/(N-1)
       </p>
  <li> Geometric: mean = 1/pi, var = (1 - pi)/pi<sup>2</sup>
       </p>
  <li> Negative binomial: k/pi, var = k(1 - pi)/pi<sup>2</sup>
       </p>
  <li> Poisson: mu, var = mu
</ul>

<h2>Tuesday/Thursday evening ride:</h2> 

Every Tuesday/Thursday evening a bunch of riders leave from
the Art Museum at 6:30 for a 1 1/2 hour ride around the park
(20 miles total).  We always wait for people who get flats.  We
have 40 riders.  Typically we two riders get 2 flats.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
       What is distribution of the number of riders who flat?
       </p>
  <li>
       What is the probability of an evening without any flats?
       </p>
  <li>
       Based on these numbers, how many flats would you expect to get
       when crossing the whole US? (say 4000 miles total)
       <ul>
	 <li>
	      What is the expected number of flats?
	 <li>
	      What is the distribution?
	 <li>
	      What is the SD?
	 <li>
	      How many tubes should you bring?
       </ul>
       </p>
</ul>
