<h2>Introduction to Estimation and Confidence intervals</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Suppose your assistant come screaming into your office and
       says: "We have gone out of bounds on the control chart!"
       <ul>
	 <P>
	 <li> Yikes!  How bad is it?
	 <li> Is going off any control chart equally bad?
	 <li> It would be a big change if it went off the daily control
	      chart.
	 <li> It would be a very small change if it went off the annual
	      control chart.
	 <li> Both require corrective actions, but they differ.
	 <li> Speed is of the importance for the daily problem--whereas
	      accuracy is of importance for the annual chart.
	 <li> Confidence intervals try to capture this concept.
	 <li> Two pieces: best guess and accuracy
	 <li> Today we will study the idea of good guessing
	 <li> Tomarrow we study accuracy
       </ul>
       </P>
  <li> Guessing = estimation
       </P>
  <li> Estimate the width of a wire
       <P>
       <ul> 
	 <li> Situation: Manufacturing memory.  One important "wire
	      width" should be about 50 nm.
	 <li> Data: We use an atomic force microscope to measure widths
	      several times aday.
	 <li> Goal: Guess average width for all chips manufactured
	      today.
	 <li> estimator 1 = ave of 10 measurements made today
	      (X<sub>1</sub> + ... + X<sub>10</sub>)/10
	 <li> Estimator 2 = ave of 1000 measurements made over the
	      past 100 days
	 <li> Estimator 2 could be biased
       </ul>
       </P>
  <li> Estimators are random variables!
       </P>
  <li> Estimators have distributions, means, variances
</ul>
<h2>Estimation</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Unbiased: E(estimator) = truth
       <P>
       <ul>
	 <li> What if there are many unbiased estimators to choose from?
	      (mean, median, max+min/2 all are unbiased)
	 <li> Picking the one with the smallest standard deviation is called
	      picking the "most efficient" estimator
       </ul>
       </P>
  <li> Consistent
       <P>
       <ul>
	 <li> Is the estimator close when n is large?
	 <li> Example: using the median to estimate mu in an
	      exponential.  Median --> half life which doesn't equal
	      the mean.
       </ul>
       </P>
</ul>
