This homework is to be done individually.  It is due on the last day
of class.

     <ol type="a">

<li> Taxicabs are numbered from 1,2,...,N.  We want to estimate N, the
     total number of taxicabs.  We will observe n (n less than N)
     cabs.  Denote their number by Y<sub>1</sub>,...,Y<sub>n</sub>.
     We consider two estimators for N:
     </p>
     <ol type="i">
         <li> Estimator 1 is (2 Y-bar - 1) where Y-bar is the
	      average of all the Y's observed.
	 <li> Estimator 2 is Maximum of
	      Y<sub>1</sub>,...,Y<sub>n</sub>.
     </ol>
     </p>
     Assume that the n taxicabs that we will see is a simple random
     sample of the N cabs.  (Sampling without replacement).  We want
     to compare estimator 1 to estimator 2.  To this end, assume that
     N = 4 and n = 2.
     <ol type = "a">
          <li> Write down the 4 choose 2 possible samples of taxi
	       numbers.
	  <li> Write down the sampling distribution of teach of the
	       estimators.  (Sketch the probability distribution function.)
	  <li> Which of the estimators is unbiased?  Note that the true
	       answer is N = 4.
	  <li> Which estimator is closer to 4 on the average, where
	       closeness is measured by
	       <p>
	       <center>(estimate - 4)<sup>2</sup>?</center>
