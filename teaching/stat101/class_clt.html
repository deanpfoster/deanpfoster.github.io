<a href="lightbulb.JMP">Light bulb data</a>

<ul>
  <li> Accelerated life testing.  (By using overvotage, you can
simulate 10,000 hours of life in a few hours of real time.)
</P>
  <li> Each minute a sample bulb is pulled from the production line
</P>
  <li> It is tested and recorded
</P>
  <li> Goal: 1000 hours average life--but want to "know" it is over
       900 hours (so within 10 percent of target)
</P>
  <li> If we test a few bulbs and stop production whenever our average
       is less than 900 hours, how often do we cry "wolf"?
  <li> What is the distribution of the average?  (This is a hard problem)
</P>
  <li> But if we average enough, it looks normal
</P>
 </ul>
Key points
<ul>
  <li> Standard deviation goes down as 1/sqrt(n)
</P>
  <li> Shape gets more normal as n increases
</P>
 </ul>
</p>
 Problem
<ul>
  <li> Suppose we want to be 6-sigma sure of being over 900 hours by
       chance alone. How many bulbs should we collect?
  <li> Note: 6-sigma for normal is .000 000 002 or 1/500 Million!
 </ul>
