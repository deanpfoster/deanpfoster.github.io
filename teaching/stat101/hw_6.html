<center><h2>Statistics 101 Problem Set #6 Fall 1999</h2></center>

This homework is to be done in groups of up to three people.  It is
due on the last day of class.
<p>
 Write a report to respond to the following situation. The
report should consist of:
     <p>
     <ol type="a">
       <li> An executive summary that states your conclusions
       <li> A nontechnical report of your basic results
       <li> Technical backup, including any relevant output and graphics
     </ul>
     </P>
     The executive summary should be a summary, not an
     introduction. It should highlight results, not your actions. The
     report should be more detailed but should avoid technical language
     such as skewness. The technical backup is an appendix, in effect.
     <p>
     
     This is the Case at the end of Chapter 2 of H&O, pp. 63-4.
     The data may be downloaded from the web.  You can find the data (<a
href="http://diskworld.wharton.upenn.edu/~foster/teaching/stat101/meat.jmp">meat.jmp</a>)
 on the
     Stat 101 main page.  

     <p>
     A meat packer sells frozen "12 ounce" steaks to restaurants. The
     meat is cut, frozen, and packaged on two production lines called
     (not-too- imaginatively) the Left and Right lines. The target
     size for each steak is 12 ounces, but there is variability
     because of differences in meat density, slight differences in
     cut, slight differences in fat content, and several other
     factors. Each steak is visually inspected and also weighed by a
     rough scale along the production line; the scale is supposed to
     reject any steak that weighs less than 11.5 ounces and set aside
     any steak that weighs more than 12.6 ounces.  
     <p>
     The production managers have noticed an increase in the number of
     24-steak packages being rejected by customers for inadequate
     average weight. The managers traced the source of each rejected
     package and found that most had come from the Right line. They
     have written to you for help. "As you know, quality control picks
     10 steaks each week from each line for careful testing. Before
     they're cooked, they're all weighed carefully. We've got weights
     for each line for the last 25 weeks. During the first 10 weeks,
     we were running at speeds well below capacity to make sure that
     our cutting was OK. The last 15 weeks, we've been running at
     nearly full capacity. What we can't figure out is that the
     average weights from the two lines are practically identical; if
     anything, the Right line averages a little heavier. So why are so
     many more of the Right line packages coming up short?" They
     enclosed the weights for each week's sample of 10 steaks.
<p>
     Can you identify any difference between the Left and Right data
that might explain the problem? Does the difference show up after the
initial 10 weeks or during that period? Write a memorandum to the
managers; they don't know any technical terms, so try to use ordinary
English as much as possible.
