<UL>
<li> Administrivia: 
<p>
   <ul>
   <li> Turn in one of your copies of your findings.
   <li> Wharton Undergraduate Division is once sponsoring (with the
	Tutoring Center)...free of charge....Wednesday until December
	8, from 6:30 - 8:30, in room 104/105 Vance Hall.

<h2> Finanacial simulation </h2>

<ul>
<li> Show of hands: Who liked: Green? Red? White?
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li> White is like T-Bills/cash.
    <li> Green is like the market
    <li> Red is like an "internet stock."  
    </ul>
    </p>
<li> What was your final wealth for white/green/red?
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li> Make a histogram of each (0 - 2000 for white, 0 - 20,000 green)
    <li> Red mostly goes to zero, but someone will prob. be lucky (billions of dollars final wealth)<br>
    <li> (either do this on the blackboard or in JMP)
    </ul>
    </p>
<li> Growth is determined not just by the mean but also by the variance
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li> Joe's boss gets mad at him, and cuts his pay 10%
    <li> The next day, his boss says he isn't mad anymore and so gives him a 10% raise.
    <li> Why isn't Joe completely happy about this?
    <li> Notice: Joe is behind 1 percent from where he started
    </ul>
    </p> 
<li> True growth rate = mean - 1/2 variance
     <p>
     <ul>
     <li> Sometimes called the log-growth rate
     <li> Related to a utility function that looks like a log
     </ul>
     </p>
<li> To tame distribution of red, compute the log(final wealth)
     <p>
     <ul>
     <li> either use base 10 logs (to make the ploting easier) or base
     e logs (to make the drift rate meaningful) But make sure that
     everyone in class is useing the same base!
     <li> Have each group compute their three logs of final wealth
     <li> Sketch new histograms for each color (or compute logs in JMP)
     <li> red is much more spread out, but drifts left
     </ul>
     </p>
<li> Work out what should happen for Pink
     <p>
     <ul>
     <li> via example, show that the mean of pink is about 1/2 that of
     read (in other words, the mean of white is about zero) 
     <li> Via example, show that the standard deviation of Pink is
     about 1/2 that of Red (In other words, the variance of white is
     almost zero)
     <li> compute the expected log growth rate for pink (mean - 1/2 variance)
     <li> If using log-base-e, "guess" where a typical groups final pink wealth should be
     <li> collect pink data on log scale
     </ul>
     </p>
<li> Moral: Need both the mean and the variance to evaluate a stock /
bond / portfolio / option / derivative product.
<li> Next class we will discuss how to compute variances for combinations of stocks
