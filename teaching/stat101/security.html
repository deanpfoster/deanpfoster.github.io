<h1> How to discuss your grade.</h1>

<p> If you want me to send you a final grade, or current grades on
exams, homeworks etc, use one of the following two methods.  Likewise
if you want to discuss grades or other sensitive matters.

<h2> Using email (prefered method) </h2>

<p>
Email me your request.  Sign or encrypt your email using PGP.  I'll
reply in encrypted format.  

<h2> Using hardcopy (very slow method) </h2>
<p>
Type up a description of your request.  Don't assume that I might be
 able to guess what your postcard is supposed to contain!  Include
 an envelope that will return it all to you with my response.
