<h2> Examples of normal random variables</h2>
<ul>
  <li> "Blue ribbon panel" predicts GNP growth will be 3.25% next year.
       Typical error 2%.  What is the probability of "negative growth?"
       </p>
  <li> Intel produces 10,500 chips a day.  On average 6300 pass the
       burn in test, with a standard deviation of 50.  Any line
       manager who has fewer than 6000 passed tests is fired.  What is
       the chance of this happening by chance alone?
       <p>
       How would we have determined the SD if were weren't told its
       value?
       </p>
  <li> In a 10 person "devil take the hindmost" race, if you are in
       the bottom 10% for speed, you will lose the first lap.  Suppose
       the mean speed for the race is 30 mph with a standard deviation
       of .1 mph.  How fast is the bottom 10% going?
       </p>
  <li> A 15 oz box of Captain Crunch should contain at least 15 oz,
       most of the time.  The filling machine has a SD of .1 oz.
       General Mill's wants to besure that 99% of the boxes are filled
       full enough.  What should they set the mean production level
       for the machine to be?
</ul>
<h2> Approximations</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Approximating the binomial by a normal
       </p>
  <li> Approximating the Poisson by a normal
       </p>
  <li> Why can't we approximate a geometric by a normal?
</ul>
<h2> General approximations</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Approximating the sum of anything by a normal
       </p>
  <li> called the "Central Limit Theorem" or CLT
       </p>
  <li> Generally used in taking averages;
       </p>
       <ul>
	 <li> What is the average height
	 <li> What is the weight of a widget
	 <li> What is the average number of bad tracks on a hard disk?
	 <li> etc
       </ul>
</ul>
