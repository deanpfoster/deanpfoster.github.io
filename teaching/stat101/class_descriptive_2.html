<li> Homework: You should do problems 1 & 2 over the weekend.  You
might sit down with a friend and both go thru problem 4 (the computer
assignment).  We will cover the information for doing problem 3 on

<li> Histogram = summary of data with a graph
</p>
<li> Statistics = summary of data with a number
</p>
<li> Examples of statistics
<p>
<ul>
<li> mean = average
<li> variance = average squared deviation
<li> standard deviation = squareroot of variance
<li> median = middle of data
<li> Range = top - bottom (a bad statistic)
<li> IQR = top 25% - bottom 25%
</p>
</ul>
<li> The key advantage of a statistic is that you can present many of them all at once
</p>
 (Think about drawing 10 histograms.  It generates a very cluttered picture.)
</p>
<li> Box plots--a compromise between statistics and graphics
</p>
<li> Look at total-comp by area (<a href="http:forbes94.jmp">forbes.jmp</a>)
