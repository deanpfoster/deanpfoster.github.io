<UL>
<li> Administrivia: 
<p>
  <ul>
  <li> Readings: Do them after class (sometime during the week listed)
  <li> Homework due next class
  </ul>
</p>
<li> The normal distribution
<p>
  <ul>
  <li> generated by many small effects
  <li> e.g. height of child = genes + food + protein + good health + ...
  <li> single peaked
  <li> two parameters--mean and standard deviation
  </ul>
</p>
<li> The empirical rule. Much data is approximately normally and hence the follow is true:
<p>
  <ul>
  <li> mean +/- 1 standard deviation is about 2/3s of the data
  <li> mean +/- 2 standard deviation is about 95% of the data
  <li> mean +/- 3 standard deviation is about 99.8% of the data
  </ul>
</p>
<li> testing for a normal distribution
<p>
  <ul>
  <li> Eye ball it.  Does it look normal? (requires training)
  <li> Normal probability plot
  <li> Staying within the confidence bounds
  </ul>
</p>
  <li> Two years of GM stock returns: 
        <a href="http:gm87.jmp">gm87.jml</a> and 
	<a href="http:gm92.jmp">gm92.jml</a>.

</ul>
