<center><h1>Stat 101: Last day of class</h1></center>

<ul>
  <li> Admistrivia
       <p>
       <ul>
         <li> Demonstrate "stack" and "split" on meat packing data to
              make data into usual single column
	 <li> Exam is in ANNS 110 Dec 20th 4-6PM
	<li> extra office hours Dec 16th - 20th
       </ul>
       </p>
</ul>
<h2>Confidence intervals: T-distribution</h2>
<ul>
 <li> Example:  On the last three jobs that were bid by Joe's
Construction, the cost overruns were: 50%, 100%, and 150%.  This gives
an X-bar of 100% and a s-hat of 50%.  Find a 95% confidence interval.
Does it seem that Joe's Construction is cheating on their bids?
</p>
<li> Example: A rowing team wants to pick the 8 strongest rowers.
Each is put on an "erg" machine and has her average Watts measured.
Typically there is a 10 Watt difference between rowers, so it is
desired to measure each rower to within 5 Watts.  But the daily
fluctuation has a SD of 30 watts.  How many days on the erg machine
must each rower do?  What assumption would be violated?
</ul>
<h2>Review</h2>
<ul>
<li> Continuous random variables (uniform, exponential, normal)
</p>
<li> Quality control
<p>
   <ul>
     <li> be able to interpret both mean and s plots
     <li> recognize two sorts of problem--incorrect mean, too much variability
   </ul>
</P>
<li> central limit theory (averages are normal eventually!)
</p>
<li> checking normality (normal probability plots)
</p>
<li> confidence intervals
<p>
  <ul>
     <li> binomial
     <li> normal
     <li> t
     <li> sample size determination
  </ul>
</ul>
