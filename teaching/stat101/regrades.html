<title> Dean Foster's regrading policy</title>
</header>
<body>



<h1>No free options</h1>

<p>
 If a regrade always yield a higher grade, submitting an exam for a
regrade would consist of a free option.  If I have done a good job
teaching how to make decisions, everyone in the class would take the
free option and I would have to regrade every exam.  So, I'm unwilling
to give out free options.

<p> One way of not giving out a free option would be to charge say 5
points for a regrade.  If the regrade only increase your grade by 4
points, you would be one point behind.  This would keep regrades from
being free options.  But, the 5 point fee is set arbitarilly by me and
so isn't fair.

<p> An way to avoid handing out free options is to get rid of the
option altogether.  In other words, there is no guarentee that the
grade will go up.  If 1/2 of the regrades go down in total points and
1/2 go up in total points, only people who really belief that there
has been an error in their exam would risk submittting an exam for a
regrade.  This is a fairly standard policy--and is the one that I will use.


<h1> How to submit work for a regrade.</h1>
<p>
The regrade will be based only on what you submit in writing, not
what you might tell me in person.  With some 200+ students, I am
likely to say, "of course that makes sense" in office hours and then
totally forget what you told me when I look at it a few hours later.

<p>
Regrades will only be discussed in office hours if no one needs help
on material.  Learning takes precedence over grading!  You will still
have to follow one of the two methods below before your regrade can
take effect.

  <h2>
Using email (preferred method) </h2>

<p>
Email me a description of why you feel your grade is currently
incorrect.  Drop the exam/homework in my mail box or give it to me in
class.  Sign/encrypt your email using PGP.  I'll reply in encrypted
format.  You can pick up the exam/homework from me me anytime after
that.

<h2> Using hardcopy </h2>
<p>
Type up a description of why you feel your grade is currently
incorrect.  Staple your statement to your exam/homework and drop it in
my mailbox.  Include an envelope that will return it all to you with
my response.  I most likely won't bring them by class.

<h2> Addition errors only </h2>
<p>
If there is an error in totalling up your score, you may write this on
the cover of your exam.  All else requires more detail on your part.
