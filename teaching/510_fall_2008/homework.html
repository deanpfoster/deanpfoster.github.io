<h2>Homework 1</h2>
<ul>
  <li> These are all from <a href="combinatorial analysis.PDF">chapter
1</a>. 
  <li>

 For a warm up, start with page 22 self test.  Do these for fun!
(I.e. don't turn them in.)  They are worked out in detail in the back
of the book.  So if you are having trouble with one of the questions
following, you might want to try some of these.


  <li> Turn in the following
     <ul>
        <li> page 16 (problems): 1, 3, 9, 13, 21
        <li> page 19 (theory): 5, 8, 9, 13
     </ul>
   <li> If you try these before Monday's class and have difficulties,
ask about them in class.  I expect to spend about 15 minutes a day working on
problems in class.  But I only do that if someone asks about a problem.
</ul>

<h2> Homework 2</h2>
<ul>
   <li> Figure out where the new room is: JHMM G86.
   <li> Start by looking at the self test problems on page 63 
ensure you understand the chapter.  Don't turn them in.
  <li> Turn in the following:
     <ul>
       <li> page 16 (problems): 31
       <li> page 19 (theory): 23
       <li> page 55 (problems): 2, 3, 10, 15, 32, 34, 46, 54 (for
problem 54, think inclusion-exclusion)
       <li> page 61 (theory): 1, 4, 10, 16, 20
     </ul>
</ul>

<a name="three">
<h2> Homework 3</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Start by looking at the first 7 self test problems on page
128.  (Don't turn these in.)
  <li> Turn in the following:
     <ul>
       <li> page 61 (theory): 17, 19 (Note: this way of drawing balls
from an urn mimics the way you enter people into a clinical trial.)
       <li> page 111 (problems): 3, 8, 11
       <li> page 124 (theory): 1, 3 
     </ul>

  <li> Note to 5/6 edition users.  The numbers have changed a lot on
this one.  Please check with Brett (one of the students:
brett dot hannigan at gmail dot com) who knows the decoding.
</ul>

<h2> Homework 5</h2>

</ul>


<h2> Practice questions for first midterm </h2>
<ul>
  <li> To see my style of writing exam questions, <a href="midterm_2000.pdf">here</a> is an exam I
wrote several years ago.  Here are the <a
href="answers.pdf">answers</a>.
  <li> Review of material you have already done homeworks on:
     <ul>
  <li> page 16: 11, 20, 30, 32 (too hard for exam)
  <li> page 19: 13
  <li> page 22: all the self test aree about the right level for exam
questions
  <li> page 55: 4, 8, 13, 31, 53
  <li> page 61: 13
  <li> page 63: again the self test are nice problems (15, 16, 17 are
too hard though for exam)
  <li> page 111: 5, 8, 36, 45, 59
  <li> page 124: 1, 15
  <li> page 128: 6, 8, 9, 16, 21, 25
    </ul>
  <li> New material:
    <ul>
      <li> page 187: 13, 17, 19, 22, 24, 29, 32, 38
      <li> page 197: 3, 4, 6
      <li> page 201: 1 - 12 are good exam questions.  
    </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Homework 6</h2>
<a name="six">
<ul>
<li> Some quick <a href="midterm_2008_answer.pdf">answers</a> to today's
midterm. (I haven't really vetted these, so if you find errors/typos,
let me know.)  I've heard the exam was somewhat surprizing.  It is the
first time I've written multiple choice for an upper level class.  (It
may be my last time also given the feed back so far.)  Have a good
afternoon. 

<li> The grader request people take a bit more care in writing up your
homeworks.  It is worth while making the presentation understandable.
That is very useful in helping with your understanding.  
   <li> Read 4.6, 4.7 and 4.8.  These are necessary for the problems,
but I won't cover them in class.
   <li> page 187: 33, 46, 48, 65, 79
   <li> page 197: 8, 16, 22, 27
</ul>


<h2>Homework 7</h2>
<a name="seven">
<ul>
   <li> Read chapter 5.

   <li> Turn in:
     <ul>
     <li> page 247: 1, 4, 12, 14, 31, 35 (5.5.1 has definition of
hazard), 40
     <li> page 251: 5, 6, 9, 27, 28
</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Homework 8</h2>
<a name="eight">
<ul>
   <li> Read chapter 6. (skip section 6.6)
   <li> The self-test problems starting on page 323 are good practice
        (but don't bother with 8, 9, 18, or 19.)
   <li> Turn in:
     <ul>
     <li> page 313: 6, 7, 9, 10, 20, 43

<ul>
   <li> Read sections 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3
   <li> Turn in:
     <ul>
     <li> page 408: 1 (Try to do this using random variables and not
enumeration of all possiblities).
     <li> page 408: 9, 11, 13, 14
     <li> page 418: 1, 4, 5, 9 (Sorry--I was mistaken in class.  THere
is no other trick recognizing both sides are the expectation.)	
     <li> Bonus question: On page 322, problem 33. (This requires
using a Jacobian.  We didn't cover it in class.  But if you know how
to do this, you will have fun I'm sure!)
</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Homework 10</h2>
<a name="ten">

href="../../research/being_warren_buffett.pdf">being warren
buffett</a>" which was the content of the class before thanksgiving:
   <ol>
     <li> Suppose you are working with your grandmother on how she should
     allocate the money she has saved.  She is considering two
     investments, Tbill's which have a annual return of .03 and a
     variance of zero, and the market which she believes will have an
     annual return of .07 and a variance of .2<sup>2</sup>.  Suppose
     she is interested in maximizing her long run growth rate, then
     how should she allocate her money between t-bills and stocks?
     (Note: we are modeling her feelings of risk adversion by the fact
     that she expects the returns to be lower than the empircal
     average is.)
   <li> What is the optimal combination of Red, Green and White?  What
     will its long run growth rate be?  (Feel free to treat white as
     having zero mean and zero variance.)
   </ol>
</ul>
