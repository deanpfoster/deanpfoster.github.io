<h1>Statistical computing: Homework 1</h1>
<p>
This is the first of many short homework.  It is due Jan 19th, 1998.
</p>
<h2>Grading policy:</h2>
<p>
 My goal is to make sure you understand the concepts from each week as
we go along.  So it is important to do it immediately.  To encourage
you, I will take off 2/10 for each day late.  So turn it in by the
following Friday for any positive credit.  Even if you don't finish it
by ``zero points day,'' you will still need to finish it to complete
the course.
<P>
<h2>Homework writeups:</h2> 
<p>
Expect to spend about 1/2 of your time
programming and 1/2 of your time writing up what you did.  You should
of course write up your results using LaTeX.  Edit your code into
your latex file and then use the  \tt command to make it look
like typewriter output.  (This is the usual convention for presenting
code.)  Your write up should be detailed enough such that if I were to
give it to another student he/she could reproduce your results
exactly.  (Including any mistakes you might have made!)
<P>
<OL><LI> Code the two functions that compute the absolute value in
class.  Call them <TT>absoSq</TT> and <TT>absoIf</TT>.  (Recall the first
computed the square and then the squareroot.  The second tested if <I>x</I>
was greater than 0.)  Check the function on various values and see if
they both work.
<OL><LI> If you only checked the values, 3, 4.674 and 10000, do you have
confidence that your functions work?<LI> Print out the help for the <TT>unix.time</TT> command (staple it to
the end of your homework.)  Also read the help on <TT>lapply</TT> and
<TT>rnorm</TT>.<LI> Run the following command:
<P>
<P CENTER>
and
<P>
<P CENTER>
<P>
What do the above commands do?  Which runs faster, absoSq or absoIf?
Why do you think this is the case?<LI> Run <TT>absoSq(-2+3*1i)</TT> and <TT>absoIf(-2+3*1i)</TT>.  What is
happening? 
</OL>
<P>
<LI> The Fibonacci are defined as <I>F</I>(<I>x</I>) = <I>F</I>(<I>x</I> - 1) + <I>F</I>(<I>x</I>-2).  This
inductive definition requires that we specify the values for <I>x</I>=0 and
<I>x</I>=1.  Let them be zero and one respectively.
<OL><LI> Program up the Fibonacci numbers.<LI> Find the running time for <I>x</I>=1,2,3,4,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40, etc.
Plot the running time against <I>x</I>.  What shape does it follow?<LI> Plot the log running time against <I>x</I>.  What is the
slope?  How does this relate to the shape in the previous part?<LI> Estimate an equation for the running time as a function of <I>x</I>.
