<P>
This is the first of many short homework.  It is due Jan 19th.
<P>
<B>Grading policy:</B> My goal is to make sure you understand the
concepts from each week as we go along.  So it is important to do it
immediately.  To encourage you, I will take off 2/10 for each day
late.  So turn it in by the following Friday for any positive credit.
Even if you don't finish it by ``zero points day,'' you will still
need to finish it to complete the course.
<P>
<B>Homework writeups:</B> Expect to spend about 1/2 of your time
programming and 1/2 of your time writing up what you did.  You should
of course write up your results using LaTeX.  Edit your code into
your latex file and then use the  <IMG WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=30 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline27" SRC="img1.gif"  > tt command to make it look
like typewriter output.  (This is the usual convention for presenting
code.)  Your write up should be detailed enough such that if I were to
give it to another student he/she could reproduce your results
exactly.  (Including any mistakes you might have made!)
<P>
<OL><LI> Code the two functions that compute the absolute value in
class.  Call them <TT>absoSq</TT> and <TT>absoIf</TT>.  (Recall the first
computed the square and then the squareroot.  The second tested if <I>x</I>
was greater than 0.)  Check the function on various values and see if
they both work.
<OL><LI> If you only checked the values, 3, 4.674 and 10000, do you have
confidence that your functions work?<LI> Print out the help for the <TT>unix.time</TT> command (staple it to
the end of your homework.)  Also read the help on <TT>lapply</TT> and
<TT>rnorm</TT>.<LI> Run the following command:
<P>
<P CENTER>
and
<P>
<P CENTER>
<P>
What do the above commands do?  Which runs faster, absoSq or absoIf?
Why do you think this is the case?<LI> Run <TT>absoSq(-2+3*1i)</TT> and <TT>absoIf(-2+3*1i)</TT>.  What is
happening? 
</OL>
<P>
<LI> The Fibonacci are defined as <I>F</I>(<I>x</I>) = <I>F</I>(<I>x</I> - 1) + <I>F</I>(<I>x</I>-2).  This
inductive definition requires that we specify the values for <I>x</I>=0 and
<I>x</I>=1.  Let them be zero and one respectively.
<OL><LI> Program up the Fibonacci numbers.<LI> Find the running time for <I>x</I>=1,2,3,4,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40, etc.
Plot the running time against <I>x</I>.  What shape does it follow?<LI> Plot the log running time against <I>x</I>.  What is the
slope?  How does this relate to the shape in the previous part?<LI> Estimate an equation for the running time as a function of <I>x</I>.
