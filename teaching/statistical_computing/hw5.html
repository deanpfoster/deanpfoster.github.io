<h1> Statistical computing homework 5 (Spring 1998) </h1>

<p>
 To see how much can be written about how little, read the Splus help
on exp.  It is amazing how much they say about so little.  But
actually, it is useful.
</p>

<p>
One way to layout the homework answer would be to make a table with
each function in it with a short description.  Say something like:
</p>

<table border>
<TR>
<th>
function
<th> Short description
</th>

<TR>
<TD> <a href="http:sq.html">sq()</a>
<TD> Takes a  number and returns the square of the number.
</TR>

<TR>
<TD> <a href="http:d.html">d()</a>
<TD> Takes the derivative of a function.
</TR>


</table>

<p>
Here is some samples that might cause your code to break.
</p>
<table border>
<TR>
<th>
Code that might cause problems
<th>
Reason
</tr>

<TR>
<td>
<pre>
d(d(sq))
</pre>
<td>
Does d() return a function properly
</tr>

<TR>
<td>
<pre>
test <- function(f) d(f)(1)
test(sq)
</pre>
<td>
Does d() find the right lambda expression or just the name?
</tr>

<TR>
<td>
<pre>
d(function(x) x*x)
</pre>
<td>
does d() accept lambda expressions?
</tr>

<TR>
<td>
<pre>
test.arg <- 5
normal(test.arg)(5)
</pre>
<td>
does normal() handle arguments correctly
</tr>


<TR>
<td>
<pre>
chisq <- function(){
   g <- transform(normal,sq);
   g(3)}
</pre>
<td>
Can transform be called from inside a function?  (In general this is a
good thing to check since the handling of variables is kinda strange
in Splus.)
</TR>

<TR>
<td>
<pre>
test.arg <- 5
test <- function(mu) 
    { 
      normal(mu)(5)
    }
test(test.arg)
</pre>
<td>
does normal() handle arguments correctly
</tr>


<TR>
<td>
<pre>
large <- function(x) 1e20 * (x-.33)
root(large,0,1)
</pre>
<td>
Does root incorrectly complain if it is given big numbers?
</TR>

<TR>
<td>
<pre>
large <- function(x) 1e20 * (x-.33)
if(root(large,0,1) != .33) print("oops")
</pre>
<td>
Does root find enough accuracy so that equality is preserved?
</TR>

<TR>
<td>
<pre>
d(sq)(1e20)
</pre>
<td>
Can d() handle large numbers?
</TR>

<TR>
<td>
<pre>
d(sq)(1e-10)
</pre>
<td>
Can d() handle small numbers?
</TR>
