<h1>Statistical Data mining: Stepwise regression</h1>

<h2>Admistrivia</h2>
<ul>
   <li> Lots of readings for today (including new one on JL theorem.)
</ul>


<h2>Regression vs nearest neighbor (yet again)</h2>

<ul>
   <li> Nearest neighbor picks up rich structure from log(n) sized space
   <li> Regression picks up linear structure from o(n) sized space
   <li> Nearest neighbor degenerates to noise if space is too large
   <li> Regression degenerates to "divide by zero" if space is too
large
   <li> What to do?
   <li> Pick a smaller space!
</ul>

<h2>Best basis problem (best subsets regression)</h2>

<ul>
  <li> goal: find subspace that generates a good fit 
  <li> Same thing is needed for both regression and Nearest neighbor
</ul>

<h2>NP complete problems</h2>

<ul>
<li> Review complexity via sorting algorithms: O(n^2)
vs. O(2^n). (use cards)
<li> Can exponential problems be interesting?
   <ul>
   <li> No, since we can never know if the answer were correct.
   <li> Yes, since sometimes sometimes checking is easier than
deriving.
   </ul>
<li> These class of problems are called "NP".
   <ul>
   <li> No known way to actually solve them quickly.
   <li> Even quantium computers might not solve them quickly.  (Open conjecture)
   <li> All good machine learning problems fall in this class.
   </ul>
<li> Aside: NP complete
   <ul>
   <li> The whole class is either all easy, or all hard
   <li> If one problem (say TSP/3STAT, or stepwise regression).......
   <li> Sudoku are good example of NP complete problem
   </ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.claymath.org/millennium/">Millennium prize</a>
</ul>
<p>

<h2>Best subsets regression is NP complete</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Must phrase it carefully
  <li> Do there exist q < p variables such that the R-sq'd is bigger
than x?
  <li> Certainly this is polynomial time checkable (do the regression)
  <li> Can it be found quickly?
    <ul>
    <li> Try the best first? (Fails since might lead down wrong path)
    <li> Add them all and eliminate useless ones (fails since p might
be bigger than n)
    </ul>
  <li> reduce it to another previously shown to be hard problem
  <li> So if someone says, "I've got a fast way to solve subsets
regression" they shouldn't be telling statisticians, instead they
should be telling the Clay foundation.
</ul>

<h2>"All interesting problems are impossible."</h2>
<ul>
  <li> How do we solve them?
</ul> 

<h2>Gready search</h2>
