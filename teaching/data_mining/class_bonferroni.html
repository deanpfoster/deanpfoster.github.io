<h1>Statistical Data mining: Bonferroni</h1>

<h2>Admistrivia</h2>
<ul>
   <li> Please do the reading
   <li> (we have ways to know what you read!)
   <li> When DRM come around this will be actually be true.
</ul>

<h2>Can't compute best fit in general, so assume orthoganal</h2>
<ul>
   <li> Avoid colinearity
   <li> optimization problem is now seperatable
   <li> Optimize each coordinate individually.
</ul>


<h2>Which variables should be included?</h2>

<ul>
   <li> Adding any variable increases insample fit
</ul>
<h3>So: Add them all</h3>
<ul>
   <li> Adding any variable increases insample fit
   <li> But in sample fit is not an unbiased estimate of out-of-sample
        fit.
   <li> Adjusted-R-sqd is "unbiased" if no selection is done
   <li> Adding a variable with t &le 1 actually decreases the the
adjusted-r-sqd. 
</ul>
<h3>So: Add all of them with a t > 1</h3>
<ul>
   <li> If |beta| &lt 1 fitting by zero is better than fitting by
betahat.
   <li> E(t<sup>2</sup>) = beta<sup>2</sup>/SE<sup>2</sup> + 1
   <li> So t<sup>^2</sup> - 1 is an unbiased estimate of
beta<sup>2</sup>
   <li> Related to Stein's unbiased estimate of risk (more on this later)
   <li> IDEA: if less than 1 leave it out, otherwise put it in
   <li> This is the idea of: AIC, C<sub>p</sub>
</ul>
<h3>So: Add all of them with a |t| > sqrt(2)</h3>
<ul>
  <li> But assumptions for AIC are violated if you use do variable
selection.
  <li> So lets focus on selection
  <li> |t| > sqrt(2 log p) rarely occur under the null
</ul>
<h3>So: Add all of them with a |t| > sqrt(2 log p)</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Called Bonferroni
     <ul>
     <li> Prove tail of the null: Phi(x) < phi(x) for x < -1.
     <li> Prove sum of events: P(U A<sub>i</sub>) &le sum P(A<sub>i</sub>)
     </ul>
  <li> First suggested by Foster and George (for regression) / Donoho
and Johnstone (for wavelets)
