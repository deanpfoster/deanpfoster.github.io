<h1>Statistical Data mining: Streaming searching</h1>

<h2>Admistrivia</h2>
<ul>
   <li> Homework 3 next class.
</ul>

<h2>ID1 stepwise regression</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Nearest neighbor 1
  <li> As we discussed previously, need to do subspace selection
  <li> Modelling after forward stepwise
     <ul>
     <li> Test a bunch of features
     <li> Evaluate each on to see how it performs
     <li> Add the best feature
     </ul>
</ul>
<h2>Classification evaluation</h2>
<ul>
   <li> calinski-harabasz
   <li> T. Calinski and J. Harabasz. A dendrite method for cluster
analysis. Communications in statistics, 3(1):1--27, 1974. 2.
  <li> "C&H use the Variance Ratio Criterion which is analogous to
F-Statistics to estimate the number of clusters a given data naturally
falls into. They minimize Within Cluster/Group Sum of Squares (WGSS)
and maximize Between Cluster/Group Sum of Squares (BGSS)" <a

</ul>
<h2>Beam search and streaming</h2>
<ul>
   <li> Beam as a compromize between breadth first and depth first
   <li> Beams of width one: Same as depth first search
   <li> Beams of unbounded with is stepwise in this context
   <li> Not address in paper: order of variables 
</ul>
