<h1>Statistical Data mining: Bonferroni</h1>

<h2>Admistrivia</h2>
<ul>
   <li> Homework due today.  More homework due next week
</ul>

<h3>So: Add all of them with a |t| > sqrt(2 log p)</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Called Bonferroni
     <ul>
     <li> Prove tail of the null: Phi(x) < phi(x) for x < -1.
     <li> Prove sum of events: P(U A<sub>i</sub>) &le sum P(A<sub>i</sub>)
     </ul>
  <li> First suggested by Foster and George (for regression) / Donoho
and Johnstone (for wavelets)
</ul>
<h2>Started with "fit" ended with paranoia</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Back to first principles
  <li> Goal is a good fit: Too poorly defined
  <li> Goal is a good worst-case fit: Bad goal since encorages adding
all variables
  <li> Goal is good fit over each size model: Idea of Risk Inflation
</ul>
<h2>Risk inflation</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Definition: ratio of risks to best
  <li> Alternative definition: compared to oracle
  <li> Look at table 2 from paper to see how some simple methods do
