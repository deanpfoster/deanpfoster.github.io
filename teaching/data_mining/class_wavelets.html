<h1>Statistical Data mining: Wavelets</h1>

<h2>Admistrivia</h2>
<ul>
   <li> I put your homework in your mail boxes
   <li> Read, read, read!
</ul>

<h3>Problem: curve fitting</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Splines are classical way of fitting curves
  <li> E.g. piecewise linear
  <li> Often more smoothness, so piecewise cubic say?
  <li> allows derivatives to match
</ul>
<h3>Where to put the knots?</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Very non-linear model.  Moving knots changes fit
  <li> Even counting degrees of freedom isn't easy
</ul>
<h3>Competitors to splines</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Fourier bases (sines and cosines)
  <li> Polynomials
  <li> wavelets (piecewise Fourier?)
  <li> Both linear
</ul>
<h3>Fourier can't fit jumps</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Consider jump
  <li> Spline can fit by outting two knots at jump
  <li> Fourier runs into "Gibbs" phenomena
  <li> So to polynomials (reason for knots in the first place)
  <li> Wavelets only get hit with a log badness
</ul>
<h3>Splines can be approximated by wavelets</h3>
Theorem: (DJ94) R(SW,f) < a + b log(n)R(PP,f)
<ul>
  <li> SW = selective wavelet (best basis possible)
  <li> PP = piecewise polynomial
  <li> note: splines are subset of PP
</ul>
<h3>Bonferroni can approximate best wavelet</h3>

Theorem: (DJ94) R(Bonferroni,f) <  (1 + 2 log(n)) * (sigma<sup>2</sup> + R(SW,f))
<ul>
  <li> Identical to Risk inflation
</ul>
<h3>Can anything beat Bonferroni?</h3>

Theorem: (DJ94) For some n: R(anything,f) > (2 - epsilon)  log(n)R(SW,f)
