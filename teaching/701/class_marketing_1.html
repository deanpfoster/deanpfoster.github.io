<h2>Announcement</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Homework 4 discussion
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Only do one of each type (thank a persistent student for this change)
	 <li> the "q" is in the second half of the data
       </ul>
       <p>
  <li> Linear regression of the coeficients
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Suppose all betas were thought to be the same
	 <li> Now suppose they linearly decay
	 <li> Finally suppose the last value should be zero
       </ul>
</ul>

<H2>Finishing up Autocorrelation</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Time Series in JMP without using the TS platform
</ul>
<H2>Supply and demand estimation</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Difficulties in observational studies
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Suppose you watch the price go up and consumption goes down, why might this occur?  (answer: downward sloping demand curve)
	 <li> Suppose you watch the price go up and production goes up, why might this occur? (answer: upward sloping supply curve)
	 <li> NOTE: production = consumption.  
	 <li> Suppose you watch the price go up and production/consumption stays the same? (answer: ???)
	 <li> Draw two sets of (P,Q) graphs that have same observations, but different elasticities
	 <li> Without controlled experiments it is very hard to deconvolve these two.  Impossible even?
       </ul>
       <p>
  <li> Difficulties in controlled experiments
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Must offer different people different prices
	 <li> Amazon could do this (except of the very bad publicitity)
	 <li> Plot number sales vs price generates demand curve
       </ul>
</ul>
<H2>Elasticity experiments</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Background
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Minks in their <a href="http://www.bcadventure.com/adventure/wilderness/animals/mink.htm">natural habitat</a>.
	 <li> Minks in their <a href="http://www.emerchandise.com/images/p/MMR/pdPOMMR0001.jpg">economic
habitat</a>.
	 <li> Minks making the <a href="http://www.worldanimal.net/mink.html">transistion</a>.
       </ul>
       <p>
  <li> The experiment
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> 16 mink were allowed to "purchase" different items
	      <ul>
		<li> Water pool
		<li> alternative nest site
		<li> novel objects
		<li> raised platform
		<li> toys
		<li> tunnel
		<li> control (empty cage)
	      </ul>
	 <li> The price was the weight of a door that had to be lifted
	 <li> draw price/quantity graph
	 <li> Variables measured:
	      <ul>
		<li> total weight lifted
		<li> elasticity (for each individual mink)
		<li> Travel cost consumer surplus
		<li> maximum price
	      </ul>
       </ul>
</ul>
