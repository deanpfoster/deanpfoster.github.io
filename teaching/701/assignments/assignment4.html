Assignment #4

<p>
This assignment builds a regression tree for the amount spent by
customers who visit amazon.com and purchase an item in the video games
category. The following questions thus resemble those considered in
class.  In that example, we built a regression tree for the amount
spent on toys; only the purchase type has changed.  As in that example,
amazon.com would like to understand the demographic characteristics of
customers; in particular, it would like to know which segments
of customers buy heavily and which purchase relatively small amounts.
It would also like to learn whether customers coming from the various
referring sites are similar, or perhaps learn whether referrals from
some sites generate larger sales.

<p>

NOTE: Answer all the questions as briefly as you can.  Unlike
previous exercises which emphised communcation skills, the purpose of
this exercise is to expose you to trees.  

<ol>

<li> Extract the video game purchasers from the amazon_baskets.jmp
file.  Place these in a separate file (which should have 545 rows).
From these 545, reserve a validation sample of 145 cases, leaving the
other 400 for estimation.  Conclude this step by showing a comparison
of the amount spent on video games in the two samples; in particular,
are there significant differences in spending?  Should there be?

<li> Construct a balanced tree having only 3 splits.  As the
predictors, use all of the factors in the data file from Referring
Domain through Income (continuous).  Allow the software to pick the
optimal split, but keep the tree balanced. Show the tree summary and
offer a brief interpretation.  Do the 3 splits look meaningful?

<li> Continuing from the balanced tree used in Q2, continue the
splitting by allowing the software to chose both how and where to
split.  Continue until you believe the data no longer support further
splits.  For the resulting tree

<ol>
<li> Show the tree diagram,
<li> Offer a
brief interpretation of the meaning of this tree, noting particularly
the roles of demographic factors like age, income, and education
<li> Explain how you stopped the fitting process.
</ol>

<li> Are the trees described in Q2 and Q3 calibrated?  Show the
appropriate plots.

<li> Fit a regression model which is motiviated by one of your trees
above.  Do you like it better or worse than the orginal tree.
</ul>
