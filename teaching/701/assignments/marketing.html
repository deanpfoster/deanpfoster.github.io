This assignment is the second half of assignment 2.  It is a
discussion only assignment.  It should be as short as possible but
still communicate your primary message.  (Feel free to provide a
technical appendix.)

<p>
<h3>Background</h3>

<p> 
You are an AVP at a pharmaceutical company.  

<p>

The driving problem facing the comparing is their decision as to how
much to spend on marketing and how that money should be divided
between the various formats.  Obviously no marketing leads to no sales
at all.  On the other hand, spending more on marketing than you could
possible recoup is likewise a losing strategy.  So determining the
correct amount to spend on marketing is an important but
unfortunately difficult problem.  Obviously answering this question
requires data.  The company has already collected some observational
data.  The question you are to answer is whether the existing data is
good enough to base a decision on or should a controlled experiment be
done?

<p>

Your job is to write a memo to the higher-up that will help them
decide which data to use (the existing free data, or new data to be
collected).  You should write up a memo arguing your position (in
other words, take a position, pro or con and then defend your
position).


<h3>The decision to be made</h3>
<p>

The proposal pitched by the statistician is to get your company to run
a controlled experiment to determine the effect of marketing on sales.
In particular an expensive form of marketing is called "detailing."
How effective is this form of marketing?

<h3>Your existing data</h3>

Your individual data is available under your name in the <a
href="../project/">project</a> directory.  A description of the
variables is <a href="project_readme.html">here</a>.  Exactly what you
do with the data is up to you.  I'll pass out some further background
information about the company and marketing in this environment in
class.

<p>

<ol>
  <li> The data is to help you make your case.  It is observational
       data and so not necessarily close to what you would learn from
       a controlled experiment.  So you can analyze it carefully, or
       ignore it completely.

  <li> One issue that you need to be aware of is that there might (or
       might not) be cross elasticities between your companies
       marketing and your competitors products.  (These cross
       elasticities could be positive or negative.)  Thus the effect
       on market share and total sales might be different.

  <li> Writing style: The target audience is a high level decision
       maker in the drug company.  So like the Business week article you
       wrote earlier--you have to make your points without using technical
       details.  But, now rather than having to hold your audiences attention
       with humor, you have to hold it by having interesting content.  Also
       similar to the Business week article is the fact that your audience
       might not finish your piece.  So you better make the first paragraph
       self contained.  Don't make it a surprise ending!
</ol>
<p>
<h3>Hints</h3>
The following are ideas that might consider.  They might provide useful
ammo in your arguments.
<ol>
  <li> Which do you want to study: Rx, TherDay's, or market share? 
  <li> Compute the slope (or elasticity) of "sales" on detail.  Then
       add in detailing of your competitor.  Does it change?  Now add
       in type of doctor.  Does it change?  Now make an interaction
       with type of doctor.  Are the slopes different?
  <li> Add other forms of marketing--like samples, and mentions.  What
       happens to the confidence intervals for detail?
  <li> Think about what would happen in the above if you did a
       controlled randomized study.  Which of these effects would go
       away? 
  <li> A typical clinical trial in medicine costs several million
       dollars.  A typical phone survey costs about 100 thousand
       dollars.  The data you have in had is collected automatically
       and hence free.
  <li> Even if you are going to argue that the current data isn't
       useful, you can still pull useful statistics out of it.  You
       might find it useful to help you estimate how many doctors are
       going to have to be in your study.
  <li> Why might a detailer go to a particular doctor?  In other
       words, are they going to detail doctors that sell more drugs or
       less drugs?  Hence if you see lots of detailing being related
       to sales, is it necessarily causal?  How would randomization
       separate these effects?
</ol>
