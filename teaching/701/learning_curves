Professor Foster,

Below is the email concerning the book in question with some possible lightbulb data.  I emailed Professor Girigtfalco explaining how you would pick up the book.  Let me know if there are any problems.

Dear Dr. Zykorie, 
Sorry to be late with my response, but I have been spending a lot of time out of my office on a writing project. Yes, the book is out of print. However, I have a copy that you can have on indefinite loan. Can you come to the LRSM building, or send a messenger to get it? It will be with my secretary Irene, next to the Materials Science deptartmental office, on the second floor of LRSM. There is absolutely no hurry about returning it. Also, feel free to copy anything you want from the book. 

Sincerely, 

L.A. Girigtfalco

Essentially, I am trying to do a study on this learning curve for my Statistics 701 class.  I have been searching diligently for about a week trying to find any sales data (sales numbers, prices, possible costs, etc) to no avail.  I don't know if you have this data, and/or are allowed to pass it on to a student.  I don't really even know if you ever did the graph talked about above.  However, if you have any insights on the particular situation, that would be very helpful. Please get back to me when you get a chance.  Thanks a bunch for your time. Jeremy Zykorie
