<center><h1>  Statistics 701: Large Data sets</h1></center>


<h2>Announcement</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Discuss overfitting in last homework (Why did some people
achieve Bonferroni bounds?)
  <li> Mention group project (email me your list of members).  First
come first listed for times.  There will be a bonus for going on first
day.
  <li> Time series is due next week.
  <li> I'll post HW 5 in the next week or so.
</ul>

</ul>

<H2>Cross validation</h2>
<ul>
<li> (See handout)
<li> What is cross validation good for?
<ul>
<li> First question: What is the RMSE?
<ul>
<li> use 6 points to get the RMSE within a factor of 2.
<li> use 13 points to  get the RMSE within 50% accuracy.
<li> use 35 points to  get the RMSE within 25% accuracy.
<li> use 50 points to  get the RMSE within 20% accuracy.
<li> use 137 points to  get the RMSE within 10% accuracy.
<li> use 13,700 points to  get the RMSE within 1% accuracy.
</ul>
<li> Second question: Which is better CART/MARS/Neural nets?
<ul>
<li> Save 1/2 data for "out of sample."
<li> Do 10 fold cross-validation (which saves out 10%, but does it 10
times)
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
