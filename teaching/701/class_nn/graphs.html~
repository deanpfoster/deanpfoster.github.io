Graph 1. This is a plot of predicted probabilities estimated from the
internet demographics datset. The model was a logistic regression with two
explanatory variables, age and income. Note the smoothness of the fitted 
surface which follows from the modeling assumptions -- any wrinkles on the
true surface are ironed out by the logistic model. The model indicates that
the probability of being a"Newbie", that is using the internet for less
than 12 months increases as a function of age, but decreases as a function of
income.

Graph 2. The following graphs illustrate the ability of the neural network to
capture non-linearities. The scenario is that there are two groups in the
population. The probability of being in group 1 varies with the sin of x.
The aim is to capture from the raw 0/1 data how the probability of group 
membership depends on X. Each graph shows the predicted output from a one 
hidden layer neural network as the number of units in the hidden layer varies from 0 to 8. Note how the network is able to capture the non-linearity so long as
the number of hidden units is large enough. The approximation to the sin curve
appears to improve with the number of hidden units.

Graph 3. In this graph the predicted response probabilities are calculated 
for the internet demographics datset, but this time from a 
set of neural networks in which the number of units in the hidden layer varies between 0 and 8. Notice how the smoothness of the surfaces decreases
as the number of units increases. This figure should be contrasted with Graph 1. Graph 3 shows both the value of the network which has the ability to capture
non-linearities or "wrinkles" in the suface, and also one of the issues associated with highly non-linear models: which of the wrinkles are real, and which are a result of overfitting? In this particular dataset, a possible explanation for the ridge associated with younger people is the impact of easy access to internet links that undergraduate students enjoy. Validating the network on out of sample data is one way to go about answering the fundamental question concerning the "realness" of the observed non-linearities..

Graph 4. This graph again plots the predicted probabilties from the 
neural network, but this time after the demographics dataset has been
manipulated to include some "gold". In this case people with ages between
35 and 45, and income sbetween 35,000 and 45,000 were recoded as 1's, that is as newbies. This inserts a spike into probability surface. With enough hidden
units the network is indeed able to uncover the gold.
