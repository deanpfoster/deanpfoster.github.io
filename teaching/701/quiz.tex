In case your math isn't too good, 95\% of 20 questions is 19.  So, you
should have gotten only 1 question wrong.  If you are ``normal'' you
got more than 1/2 of the answers wrong.  In other words, your coverage
frequency was less than 50\% instead of being 95\%.

It is interesting that if you ask people after they fill in the
questionnaire how many they think they got correct, they guess closer
to 50\% than 95\%, in spite of what the instructions told them!
