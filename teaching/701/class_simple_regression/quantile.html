<H1> Quantiles and Q-Q plots</H1>
<P>


Last time we discussed Q-Q plots which plot OBSERVED against EXPECTED
quantiles. As with most diagnostics when the model holds true observed and
expected should be about equal and in the case of the Q-Q plot we hope to
see an approximate line in the plot.
<P> 
But what exactly is a <B> Quantile.</B>?

Imagine taking lots of data, enough to be able to draw an extremely
detailed histogram. Now "normalize" the histogram so that the area
beneath it equals one. The function that 
describes the shape of the normalized histogram is called a
<B>probability density function</B> and often denoted by the convention
f(x). 

The probability density function for the standard 
normal distribution looks like this:

Now imagine adding up the area to the left of a point on the X-axis. The
function that gives this area is called the <B>Cumulative Distribution Function</I> and usually written as F(x).
<P>

The cumulative distribution function for the normal distribution looks like this:

As an example, think about the area to the left of 0 for the standard normal 
above. Since it's symmetric there must be 0.5 worth of area to the left of 0. 
Which is why the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) takes on the value of 0.5
above 0. That's just the way the CDF is defined -- area to the left of in the
density graph.
<P>
Now the quantiles come about by looking at the CDF graph the other way around.
Rather than asking, "how much area is there to the left of x?", the
quantile function goes the other way - "what x-value has a certain area to the left of it?" For example, we could ask "what x-value has 0.9 area to the left 
of it?". The answer to this question is precisely the 0.9 quantile, or the
90th percentile of the normal distribution. From the graph above you can see
that it's about 1.6, but of course if you want the exact number you get
it from a computer.
<P>
Finally the Q-Q plot comes into being by plotting the 
observed quantiles of the data against the 
expected quantiles
from a standard normal distribution.
