Course philosophy.
</H2>

Most of the interesting and useful ideas in statistics are conceptual
rather than mathematical -- therefore this course will focus on
understanding, interpreting and communicating modern statistical
ideas.  The course will be designed to give participants ample
opportunity to develop communication and presentation skills (aka
written reports).
