<h2>Announcement</h2>

<ul>
  <li> homework 3 issues
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> turn back homeworks
	 <li> Read excerpts from: Christopher, Jed, and Sajid
	 <li> show graph made by Nick
	 <li> 1 part E.  Few people realized that you should still
	      check the resuduals.  they just got the expected result and said "we
	      believe this one since it is what we expected."  Are the p-values here
	      any better?  Only after checking do we know this.
	 <li> 3 part 5 you need to guess!  How small a p-value will it take you to
	      be impressed.  If you truely won't believe anything than you can go
	      with "unknown = infinity."  Otherwise, you need to specifiy what
	      p-value you want to go with and hence what n you are using.
