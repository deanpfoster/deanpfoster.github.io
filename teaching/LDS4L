I very much enjoyed meeting with you yesterday, especially our
conversation on the problem of part of speech tagging.  It sounds like
you and Sham are looking at some interesting ways of tackling the
problem using CCA.  I do think multilevel Markov chain models are
interesting to consider.  I dug up a couple of references that might
be relevant to the models you are interested in.

A model with an unbounded number of Markov chain levels:

Seminal work on hierarchical HMMs, though I think the Bayesian
nonparametric paper above uses a potentially more appropriate variant:

Kevin Murphy's thesis that summarizes a number of HMM variants (pre-2002) in Chapter 2:

Also, I really appreciate your hosting the pre-dinner cocktails!  I am
glad we had a chance to chat in this less formal setting.

Looking forward to seeing you again in the future.

Best,
