Some suggestions for Steele:


1.       Return distributions, not normal.

2.       Dow Jones idiotic average.

3.       Your pet rabbit could have invented ARCH and GARCH.

4.       There is predictability of the level of volatility but NOT of
the change in level (so no more or less hope for cheese in options or
VIX futures than for plain vanilla equities)

5.       More diversification in equal weight by sectors than in
market cap allocation

6.       Duration of TIPs is weird.

7.       More risk (within an equity subset) implies… Less return (ex
post). One of many violated “risk return” stories.

8.       One day look back on best sector implies 100%+ return per
year (so hard to guess the best sector)

9.       Non trivial AR(1) wendesday-Wednesday small caps (all of the
80’s but now).

10.   More “chance for cheese” in weekly momentum than it any “other
choice”

11.   According to the Bonferroni correction, no asset has
meaningfully  out-performed the Bonds of the Third Reich, or Baseball
cards, or the 50%-50% portfolio of Nazi Bonds and Baseball cards.

 
Still, Tsai does step through the stuff that students applying for
quant jobs can rationally be expected to know. Lai also has a book
that I reviewed for JASA:
