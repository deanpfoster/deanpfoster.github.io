<UL>
  <li> Administrivia: 
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> JMP Homework due next thrusday.
	      You may work in pairs.
	      Try to start on it this weekend so that you
	      can bring in questions/problems on tuesday. 	    
       </ul>
       </p>
</ul>

<UL>
  <li> Course goal: understanding how to use statistics correctly NOT
       how to compute statistics
  <li> Today: checking our assumptions, "price of admissions" to statistics
  <li> true line --> data --> fit line --> residuals
       <ul>
	 <li> Which fits better orginal line or fit line?
	 <li> Which do we care more about?
       </ul>
  <li> Two questions:
       <ul>
	 <li> Is it a line?
	 <li> Are the residuals well behaved?  (sub questions: no patterns,
	      independent, same variance, normally distributed, no outliers)
       </ul>
  <li> Ideal regression model handout
       <ul>
	 <li> Histogram residuals, average squared deviation = variance = SD<sup>2</sup>
	 <li> Normal quantile plot
       </ul>
  <li> Look for:
       <ul>
	 <li> outliers
	 <li> influential points
	 <li> curvature
	 <li> hetroskadisticty
	 <li> lack of independence (requires thought)
       </ul>
  <li> If it passes tests, then you can use the model for predictions
       <ul>
	 <li> Prediction intervals are +/- 2 * SD
	 <li> The computer does something more accurate--show extrapolation penality picture 
       </ul>
  <li> Look at <a href="Cellular.jmp">Cellular data</a> (cell phones
       in the US from 1984 - 1995) Grew from 90k to 35M.  (handout)
       <ul>
	 <li> Not linear--use Tukey to suggest something to try
	 <li> Try log(y)
	 <li> discuss percentage changes
	 <li> Make up scale so that 1% increase equals .01 increase
	 <li> Does .10 then equal a 10%? Close enough
	 <li> Does 1.00 then equal a 100% increase? No it 271% increase!
	 <li> a .69 increase equals 100% growth.
	 <li> Try it on the data.  Not great.  Bummer
	 <li> Generate a forecast anyway for next year
       </ul>
 </ul>
