<center><h1> Two way ANOVA</h1></center>


<UL>
  <li> Administrivia: 
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Data analysis is due a week from Thursday
	 <li>
       </ul>
       </p>
</ul>
<h2> Motivating example</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Suppose you collect data twice on the individual
  <li> A "pre-test" and a "post-test", left-vs-right
  <li> Example: sensitivity training, education, nutrition,
  <li> detailed example: Suntan lotion
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Compare a new formulation of suntan lotion with an existing one 
	 <li> Plot histogram of "new suntan lotion" (Why can't you learn anything from this?) 
	 <li> Plot histogram of "old suntan lotion" (Now why can't you learn anything?)
	 <li> The two histograms overlap significantly--not much difference
	      <p>
	      <ul>
		<li> Aside: which comparison do we do?
		<li> each-pair, all-pairs, compare-with-best?
		<li> doesn't matter!  all will be the same
	      </ul>
	      <p>
	 <li> Some people burn more than others
	 <li> So look at difference for each person
	 <li> Draw histogram
       </ul>
       <p>
</ul>

<h2> How do we analyse such data?</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Easy case, only two posibilities.  Just subtract go generate constrast.
  <li> More general case, many possibilities.  Lots of pairs to compare
  <li> Think regression
  <li> We have two effects--subject and treatment
  <li> Treat each as a categorical X-planatory variable
  <li> What does the subject effect explain?  (skin color, hair color,
       eye color, general burning ability)
  <li> What does the treatment explain? (Effect of suntan lotion)
  <li> Suppose we got an R-sq of 90%, do we know the treatment made a
       difference?  NO!  It could all be subject effect.
  <li> But, the treatment might very significant now that we have
       controled for the subject effect
</ul>
<h2> JMP IN example (<a href="shoes.jmp">Boys wearing shoes data</a>) </h2>
<ul>
  <li> Which material is better for the sole of a shoe?
  <li> In this case--only two types are tested.
  <li> If we were using ponies instead of boys, we could use 4 types
       of material!
  <li> Boys are very different in their use of shoes
  <li> What if we just look at the one-way ANOVA?
  <li> Nothing significant
  <li> So do a regression
</ul>
