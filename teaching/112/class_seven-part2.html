<center><h1> Non-parallel lines</h1></center>


<UL>
  <li> Administrivia: 
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Turn in project questionnaires
	 <li> Start collecting data as soon as possible!
	 <li> The more data you collect, the easier your anaylsis will be
       </ul>
       </p>
</ul>
<h2> R-sq, F-test and doing multiple tests</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Question: "How often do you worry about what you will do after you graduate?"
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> plot vs year.
	 <li> We expect people to htink more about it as they get closer to graduating
	 <li> But what about Wharton?  It is all they think about! (My
	      introduction to business school consisted of overhearing
	      two students discussing the importance of bullets
	      vs. paragraphs on their vitas--this was before the fall
	      semester started!)
	 <li> Maybe engineers worry at first (hence majoring in
	      engineering) but realize they don't have to worry later.
	 <li> So we would get different slopes for these different
	      groups.
       </ul>
       </p>
  <li> Production example
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> R-sq'ed = variability explained = (SST - SSE)/SST
	 <li> It always increases when you add more variables
	 <li> But did it increase more than chance alone would
	      predict?
	 <li> This is the goal of the F-test
       </ul>
       </p>
  <li> Why not just use individual t-statistics/p-values?
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Each protects at 5%
	 <li> you will have at least 7 variables and 21 "interactions"
	      on your project
	 <li> Expected number of variables included by chance alone =
	      .05 * (7 + 21) = 1.4 variables
	 <li> So you will include some "noise" variables = bummer!
	 <li> The F-test protects against this somewhat.
       </uL>
       </p>
</ul>
