<center><h1> Statistical analysis of Discrimination over the past 40 years</h1></center>


<UL>
  <li> Administrivia: 
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> If you dont have a partner for your project, stay after
	      class and see if you can find one.  
	 <li> Please email me and nuria with your project proposal.
	      (See web page for email addresses)
       </ul>
       </p>
</ul>
<h3>Discrimination: the haydays</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Who got Einstiens office?  I didn't.
  <li> But I did get John de Cani's office.
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> He did "anti-discrimination" in its hayday.
	 <li> Drove around the south with the ACLU knocking down
	      discriminatory jury duty laws
	 <li> Example: 25% Blacks in state
	 <li> 250 people on juries in past year
	 <li> Not ONE black on ANY jury
	 <li> He said: "the chance of this occuring by chance alone is
	      like dealing 5 full houses in a row in poker."
	 <li> Judge said: "That would be cheating."
	 <li> he said: "Exactly."
       </ul>
       <p>
</ul>
<h3>Discrimination: modern times</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Prop. 209 (my small part)
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Prop 209 made affimative action illegal
	 <li> Continuing in the tradition of the office, I was part of
	      a ACLU friend of the court filing against it.
	 <li> We lost.
	 <li> Legacy admissions/children of allumni still allowed in
	      extra.  These forms of discrimination are still legal.
       </ul>
       <p>
  <li> Income is the battle ground now adays
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> 20% difference is considered significant (legal
	      definition)
	 <li> Statistically significant different is only sometimes
	      needed!  (should it be the definition?)
	 <li> Covariates now are used: age, profession, years worked,
	      etc.
       </ul>
       <p>
  <li> Example AAUP (American Association of University Professors)
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Every year in their salary issue, they point out three
	      problems with status of women:
	      <ul>
		<li> Women are paid less
		<li> Women are lower ranked
		<li> women are younger
	      </ul>
	 <li> Court cases don't hold up though?
	 <li> What is going on?
       </ul>
       <p>
  <li> Draw picture of age (X) and income (Y)
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> positively related
	 <li> percentage of women has been increasing (at least in
	      some fields)
	 <li> so women are younger
	 <li> thus sex and age are correlated
	 <li> thus we need to do a multiple regression
       </ul>
       <p>
  <li> Draw various pictures of age, income and color coded sex
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> easy discrimination (women uniformly lower than men)
	 <li> in equlibrium (fall on same line, at same location)
	 <li> current reality (same line?, different X distribution)
	 <li> Is this discrimination or not?
       </ul>
       <p>
</ul>
