<UL>
  <li> Administrivia: 
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> If you haven't emailed your proposal, please do so soon.
	      The next deadlines aren't as forgiving (lateness will be
	      penalized--since this is for zero points--no penalty
	      will be extracted!)
	 <li> Feel free to turn in your survey form on Thursday.
	      We'll let you know of any problems earlier if you do
	      so.  You'll be able to start collecting data earlier.
       </ul>
       </p>
</ul>
<h3>Writing good questions</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Holocaust question survey: 65% are certain it happened, vs 91%
       are certain it happened.  Which is correct?  (see overhead)
  <li> Be sure to fill out your own questionares.  You can catch some
       of these difficulties.
  <li> What about sensitive questions?
  <li> Randomized response, a justification for obtuse questions.
  <li> Have you used drugs (i.e. committed a felony) or were you born
       in a month which doesn't have the letter "r" in it?
  <li> Hint: May, June, July
  <li> Suppose 1/2 of the people say yes.  Then: 1/3 said yes because
       of birthday.  1/6 said yes because of felony.  1/2 said no
       because of wrong birthday AND no felony.
  <li> We are only interested in those NOT born in May, June or July
  <li> Conclusions: 25% have committed a felony.
  <li> Better still would be to have them roll a die
</ul>
<h3>Drawing lines</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Dad's nutrition study of Bagbanna village
  <li> weight vs. age for boys and girls (ages 8 - 12)
  <li> two regression lines? One?
  <li> In other words, which grows faster
  <li> Need to do a combined regression to decide.  So MUST do one
       multiple regression first.
  <li> No colinearity: Ages and sex are unrelated
  <li> Do example
</ul>
