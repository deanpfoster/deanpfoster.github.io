<UL>
  <li> Administrivia: 
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> JMP Homework due today.
	 <li> I listed on the schedule three more data sets to analyse
	      from the book.
	 <li> These are for "fun" not to be turned in.  You probably
	      should work in your group of two people to do these.
	      Please do them this weekend if possible.
       </ul>
       </p>

  <li> Cottages example (<a href="Cottages.jmp">jmp data</a>)
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Assumptions: notice influential outlier.  Should we
	      delete it or not?  Both have their advantages. 
	 <li> Consider building a 3000 square foot cottage
	 <li> Would it be profitable?
	 <li> Make prediction
       </ul>
       <p>

  <li> Housing prices (<a href="Phila.jmp">jmp data</a>)
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Influential point (outlier and leveraged)
	 <li> Try it with and without
	 <li> Even without the residuals look curved
	      <p>
	 <li> so try a log plot (give prediction intervals)
	 <li> interpret the log plot
	 <li> generate an actual log plot (give prediction intervals)
	      <p>
	 <li> How about loging the X axis also? (called log-log plot)
	 <li> Generates an elasticity
	 <li> slope is in %change Y/%change X
       </ul>
       <p>
  <li> Common problems in regressions (handout)
 </ul>
