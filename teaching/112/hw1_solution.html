<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">a) In our case, the relationship doesn't hold.
Generally speaking, the consumption seems to be increasing with the price
level</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">b) The regression equation is y=44.8686+9.5024*x;
its R^2 is 0.36 which means that approximately 36% of the relationship
between two variables has been explained by the regression model</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">c) The residual plot seems to exhibit some periodicity;
it is certainly not entirely random and that might indicate the presence
of nonlinearity.</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">a),b) The right-hand points are generally below
left-hand ones; this means the right-hand times are shorter and the subject
is, respectively, right-handed. The pattern for the left hand isn't very
clear and the right-hand points are squeezed at the very bottom of the
plot in a way that makes it hard to recognize a pattern</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">c) The right-hand model is y=99.4+0.0283*x with
R^2=9.3%; the left-hand model is y=172+0.262*x with R^2=10.1%. Neither
of them is very good since those results mean the distance accounts for
only 9.3%(right hand) and 10.1%(left hand) of the variation in time</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">d)The residual plot doesn't exhibit any obvious
pattern.</FONT>
