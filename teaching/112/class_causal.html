<center><h1> So if regression doesn't prove causation, what does?</h1></center>


<UL>
  <li> Administrivia: 
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Data analysis is due a week today
	 <li> Extra office hours by Nuria: 10 - 1 May 26 and 27th.
	 <li> Extra office hours by Michael: 10 - 12 Monday May 17th
	      and 10 - 12 on Thursday May 20th.
       </ul>
       </p>
</ul>
<h2>Getting started on your data analysis</h2>
<ol>
  <li> Histogram each variable (check for outliers, get to know your data)
  <li> Scatter plot your continuous variables
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> look for obvious relationships (age and year)
	 <li> look for high correlations
	 <li> check Mahmanovous distance for "multidimentional" outliers
       </uL>
       <p>
  <li> Edit data if necessary (you might have found some strange points)
  <li> color code for some of the more important categorial variables (pink/blue say).
  Look at the previous histograms and scatter plots with the new colors--see if anything striking happens.
  <li> Start multiple regression and run full model
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> kitchen sink model (throw everything that is reasonable into the model)
	 <li> look at leverage plots to see if colinearity is a problem
	 <li> look at VIF
       </ul>
       <p>
  <li> Build a reasonable model
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> find variables that you can explain
	 <li> keep it simple
	 <li> You might not find anything significant at all.  (Since isn't always fun.)
       </ul>
       <p>
  <li> check your residuals (linearity via Y vs Y-hat plot), normality via a historgram and a normal probabiltiy plot, hetroskadasticy by looking at residuals vs your important X variables.
  <li> Build another model
  <li> repeat!
</ol>
       
       
	      

<h2>Observational studies vs controled experiments</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Observational studies
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> An observation study is one where you watch the world around you
	 <li> Most of science progress this way
	 <li> Examples: Astrophysics, traditional evolution, economics, sociology
	 <li> Correct inferences can be made--but they must be made timidly
	 <li> Recall our diagrams--one of those could always be the right story
       <p>
       </ul>
  <li> controled Experiments
       </p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Manipulate the world and see the result
	 <li> The definition of the scientific method
	 <li> Examples: chemistry, psychology, microbiology, modern genetic
	 <li> Statements of causation can be made with confidence (if
	      randomization is done)
       </ul>
       <p>
  <li> Why are controled experiments stronger?
       </p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Suppose we observe X --> Y, then there might exist a Z
	      correlated with X, and Z is also correlated Y.
	 <li> Suppose we control X ourselves and see X --> Y.  Could
	      there be a Z that is corrlated with X?  YES! If we don't
	      randomize.
	 <li> Example: Stanford heart transplant data.  Picked healthy
	      subjects for surgery and frail subjects for "control
	      group."  The healthy subjects did better--sorry the
	      surgery did better.  :-)
	 <li> So controled experiments WITHOUT randomization aren't
	      any better than observational studies
	 <li> But, if X is randomized from the outcome of a coin toss,
	      then X will be uncorrelated with Z.
	 <li> So our diagram is X is unrelated to Z.  So if X is
	      correlated with Y, it is based on its own merits.
       </ul>
       </p>
  <li> These sorts of setting are the domain of ANOVA
       </p>
       <ul>
	 <li> A key advantage of regression is that you can study 20
	      x-planitory variables all at once
	 <li> In a simple controled experiment you can only do 1
	      x-planitory variable at a time--and that variable can
	      only have two levels.
	 <li> ANOVA is a way of fixing that
	 <li> Randomly assign people into treatment cells of a 2 way
	      table.
	 <li> Run regression (aka ANOVA)
	 <li> If you find a ROW effect or a COL effect you know that
	      assignemtn to ROW/COL is random and hence uncorrelated
	      with any possible lurking variable.
	 <li> So many row and many column effects can be tested at the
	      same time.  This can save lots of time!
       </ul>
