<UL>
  <li> Administrivia: 
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Courtney Bennett will say a few words about being
	      subjects in her study.  
	 <li> Stay after class to collect some data if you want
       </ul>
       </p>
</ul>
<h3>Principled model building: Example</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Suppose Y = blood presure
  <li> Xs in include: Age, time-of-day, at-work, exercising, sex,
       race, drugs-taken, billing-address....
  <Li> Maybe some interactions also
  <li> Naive rule:  Keep all X variables which have t's of 2 or more 
  <li> For example, which do you think is better to include:
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> X10 = Age with a t = 2.2
	 <li> X25 = street-address with a t = 2.7
	 <li> If you think of them as X10 and X20, the question is
	      easy--X25 is better
	 <li> If you think of htem as science--X10 is better, X25 is
	      pure noise!
       </ul>
       <p>
  <li> Principled approach = use your brain
  <li> unprincipled approach = be a statistician and don't know the science
</ul>
<h3>Unprincipled approach = stepwise regression</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Story of GI's during Viet Nam war
       <ul>
       <p>
	 <li> American GI's were easy for the communist to "brain
	      wash"
	 <li> Americans tried a program of "America is wonderful."
	 <li> led to No effect
	 <li> Americans tried a program of "what is it really like in
	      China."
	 <li> Big effect--much harder to "brain wash" GIs
	 <li> This is my reason for telling you a full lecture about
	      stepwise regression
       </ul>
       <p>
  <li> run stepwise regression on <a href="Car89.jmp">Car89</a> data
       (using quadradic surface: control-click to highlight continuous
       variables--use "surface" to add them)
  <li> Run forward, change p-value to .001, run mixed
  <li> Lots of variables
  <li> Clear variables--rerun. generates a "natural" answer
</ul>
