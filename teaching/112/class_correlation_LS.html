<center><h1>Stat 112: Correlation, LS, Extrapolation</h1></center>


<UL>
  <li> Administrivia: 
       <p>
       <ul>
       <li> Sample homework problems are listed on schedule along with
            the reading.  You should do both to keep from following
            behind in the class.
       </ul>
       </p>
<li> Measuring the degree of association
  <p>
   <uL>
   <li> Positive and negative LINEAR associations are measured by
        correlation
   <li> Perfectly postive = +1, perfectly negative = -1, no
        association = 0 (see page 130 for pictures)
   <li> Nice property: scale independent (try Y=chance of snow,
        X=temp)
   <li> Bad property: scale independent! (Y = MPG, X = engine size)
   <li> Called r
  </p>
</ul>
<li> What if it isn't linear
  <p>
    <ul>
    <li> Tukey's "bulging rule"
    <li> Draw a circle, divide into 4 pieces
    <li> Upper left: sqrt X, log X, 1/X, Y<sup>2</sup>
    <li> Upper right: X<sup>2</sup> Y<sup>2</sup>
    <li> Lower left: sqrt X, log X, 1/X, sqrt Y, log Y, 1/Y
    <li> Lower right: X<sup>2</sup>, sqrt Y, log Y, 1/Y
    <li> So transform data then do analysis
    <li> Example: Boat price vs boat length
    </ul>
  </p>
<li> Which line to use for a blob of points?
  <p>
    <ul>
    <li> Suppose X and Y aren't related (i.e. correlation = 0)
    <li> Try both flat and 45 degree line--both seem to fit equally
         well
    <li> Think about prediction though.  If you wanted a large Y,
         would you be better off picking a small X or a large X?
    <li> This is what the LS line tries to answer
    <li> Observed = predicted + error.  Draw a picture! (or see p 140)
    <li> r = visual LS slope
    </ul>
   <p>
<li> Equation for LS line
  <p>
    <ul>
    <li> Centercept: (X-bar, Y-bar)
    <li> slope: b = r s<sub>Y</sub>/s<sub>X</sub>
    <li> predicted y = a + b x
    </uL>
  </p>
<li> Extropolation
  <p>
    <ul>
    <li> Good life: small error in slope = big error in prediction
    <li> Bad life: linear doesn't even hold
    <li> Blood presure = 70 + age / 2
    <li> What is blood presure at age 1000? (prediction = explosion,
         truth = 0!)
    </ul>
  </p>
<li> Use a computer!
  <p>
    <ul>
    <li> It is more important to get a computer to do the above for
         you than to be able to do it in your head.
    <li> Use JMP IN to do some of the homework.
    </ul>

</ul>
