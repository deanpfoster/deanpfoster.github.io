<h1> Spring 2000 Syllabus for Statistics 112</h1>

<p>
<ul>
<li> Jan 18th: <a href="class_intro.html">Introduction</a>.  Read (Reread?) 2.1
     (skip p. 115), 2.2 and 2.3 (skip pp. 143-146).  Look at problems
     2.5, 2.36 and 2.38.  

<li> Jan 20th: <a href="class_correlation_LS.html">Correlation and
     LS</a>.  Read section 2.4 and 2.5.  Look at problems 2.10, 2.19
     (don't compute, look at your graph and estimate the answer), 2.49
     (again, do it graphically)  Bring your graph and answer to class
     on Tuesday.

</p>
<li> Jan 25th: SNOW DAY!
<li> Jan 27th: <a href="class_jmp_in_intro.html">Residuals, JMP IN.</a>  Read 2.7.  

</p>
<li> Feb 1st: <a href="class_model.html">Regression model and parameters. Lurking variables.</a>
Read carefully 662 - 673.  
<li> Feb 3rd: <a href="class_assumptions.html">Assumptions.</a>

Finish reading section 10.1. (pages 673 - 681) 
<p>

Sample problems 2.20 (don't compute 2.20(b)--just guess), 2.25, 2.29,
2.34, 2.35. 

 <p>

Either by yourself or with a partner do the following two JMP
problems.  Try to work on them this weekend so if you have any
problems you can bring questions to class on tuesday.  Turn them in on
Thursday Feb 10th. 
<ol>
<li> 2.58 (<a href="./problem_2_58.jmp">jmp data</a>)(
<a href="./problem_2_58.data">ascii data</a>).

<li> 2.65 <a href="./problem_2_65.jmp">jmp data</a>)(
(<a href="./problem_2_65.data">ascii data</a>) 
<ul>
<li>
(a) Hint: To
color points: First make a historgram of left-vs-right and then use
the Row's command to color left-vs-right.  Also do Rows-symbols to
make one x and the other o.  
<li> (c) Hint: To do a regression for each 
hand seperately use the "rows exclude" command.  You might also do a 
"rows hide" to make your graphs more understandable.
<li> (d) Hint: Use the fit model command then use the dollar to save
the residuals.  Finally plot the residuals vs. the row number.
</ul>
</ol>

</p>
<li> Feb 8th: <a href="class_prediction.html">predictions and
     Hypothesis testing.</a> Read carefully 673 -- 679. 
<li> Feb 10th: <a href="class_simple_wrapup.html">Finishing up simple
     regression.</a>  Some homeworks to try are:
     <ul>
       <li> 10.6 (type the numbers into JMP).
       <li> For these three questions, 10.8, 10.9, 10.10, again type
	    the data into JMP.  To make a prediction for 
	    1918 add the year to the X column and leave the Y column blank.
	    Use the cross-hairs to get precise values for the prediction
	    intervals.  Try using a quadradic fit for the prediction interval
	    also.  Does this seem to have better coverage?
       <li> 2.76 (<a href="europe_pop_growth.dat">ascii data</a>) or
	    type it in yourself.  Transform the Y using logs and do a
	    fit.  Make a prediction interval.  Now actually take the
	    log of the population and do a linear fit and prediction
	    interval.  Use your calculator to convert this prediction
	    interval into one that predicts population. (by raising the
	    e to the log-population.)  It should agree with the first
	    prediction interval.
     </ul>>
