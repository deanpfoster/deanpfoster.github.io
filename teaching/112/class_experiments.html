<h2>Observational studies vs controled experiments</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Observational studies
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> An observation study is one where you watch the world around you
	 <li> Examples: Astrophysics, traditional evolution, economics, sociology
       <p>
       </ul>
  <li> controled Experiments (using randomization)
       </p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Manipulate the world and see the result
	 <li> Examples: chemistry, psychology, microbiology, modern genetic
       </ul>
       <p>

  <li> Controled experiments are the domain of ANOVA
       </p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Example: how long does it take to find something on a web page?
	      <ul>
		<li> number of items
		<li> distractions
		<li> layout
		<li> colors (yellow on white)
		<li> etc
	      </ul>
	 <li> If you just watch people and measure the time till they click on something
	      <ul>
		<li> you don't know if they were actually searching
		<li> maybe they knew where they were going
		<li> reading a book!
	      </ul>
	 <li> Controlled experiment: Give subjects a target to find on the page
	      <ul>
		<li> Can measure success
		<li> can measure time until the find it
		<li> can measure subjective experience
	      </ul>
	 <li> Changing X variables
	      <ul>
		<li> build many different pages and see which works best (large one-way ANOVA)
		<li> Build pages that change 2 different attributes (two-way ANOVA)
		<li> possible control for subject effect (three-way! ANOVA)
	      </ul>
	 <li> Generalizes a simple controled experiment
	 <li> If you find a ROW effect or a COL effect you know that
	      assignemtn to ROW/COL is random and hence uncorrelated
	      with any possible lurking variable.
	 <li> So many row and many column effects can be tested at the
	      same time.  This can save lots of time!
       </ul>
