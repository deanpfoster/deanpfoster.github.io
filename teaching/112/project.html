<center><h1>Stat 112 Project</h1></center>


You may work on this project in groups of two or three people.  You
will collect a survey and then analyze your data.  Then you will
analyze the data using JMP.  Finally you will write up a report on
what you found.  Each of these three pieces will be separately
collected.

<dl>
<dt> Due March 9th
</p>

<dd> Give me a list of your group and a sentence or two describing
your proposed project.  (Not for grade, but for feedback). Provide an
email address of one of people in the group.  (We will only email you
if there is something major that needs to be changed or discussed.
Feel free to turn this in early--then you will get better feed back.)

</p>
<dt> Due March 23rd (or March 28th)
</p>

<dd> Your group should turn in a one page <strong>typed</strong>
description of what you will collect.  Say what it is you want to
predice (i.e.  your <em>Y</em> variable) and what you will use to
predict it (i.e. your <em>X</em> variables).  You should have between
7 and 20 <em>X</em> variables.   Describe how you will collect
it. (phone calls, standing on Locust walk, etc.)
<p>

Attach a copy of the survey you plan on using to collect these
variables.

</p>
<dt> Due April 18th
</p>

<dd> Collect your data.  If you have two people in your group, aim for
about 100 subjects, but make sure you have at least 50 usable
subjects.  If you have three people, aim for about 150, but make sure
you have at least 100 usable subjects. If you don't use enough data,
you will end up not having any results to report.  Type your data into
a spread sheet.  Load this spread sheet into JMP.

<p>
 Write a one page <strong>typed</strong> summary of your
statistical findings.  Say what variables you will use and describe
your best fitting equation is.  Attach copies of JMP output.  (The
attached JMP output can look kinda ugly at this stage.)  My primary
goal is to make sure that you have finished the statistical analysis
at least a week before you write up your results.  is the least
important.
</p>
<dt>Due April 25th
</p>
<dd>  Write up your findings (<strong>typed</strong> of course).
This should include the following:

<ol>
<li> An abstract of your project (75 words or fewer).
<li> An introduction  to the science of your project.
<li> A methods section which discusses how you analyzed the data with
graphs and tables.  
<li> A conclusions section.
</ol>
</p>

</dl>
The breakdown for the four parts will be 0%, 30%, 20% and 50%
respectively.
