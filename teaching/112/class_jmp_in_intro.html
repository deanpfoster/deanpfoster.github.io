<UL>
  <li> Administrivia: 
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Office hours: Nuria Wednesday 11-12, Michael Thursday
11-12.
       </ul>
       </p>
</ul>

<UL>
<li> outcome = fit + residual
   <p>
   <ul>
   <li> equivalently: pattern + noise
   <li> science is interested in the fit/pattern
   <li> Statistics studies the resudual/noise
   <li> the residuals shouldn't have any pattern to them
   <li> draw ideal, curvature, heteroskadasticity
   </ul>
   <p>
<li> JMP IN of <a href="metabolic_rate.jmp">metobolic_rate.jmp</a>
   <p>
   <ul>
   <li> 2.10, plot, positive/negative association, males vs females?
   <li> 2.19 Color the plot.  Symbol the plot.  What is your guess
	of correlation for men and women?  Mean for men and women?
        Kgs/lbs change the correlation?
   <li> 2.49 Y = a + bX.  change to lbs, what is the slope?  Mean of
        men?
   <li> Find the forecast for your weight.  (atheletes = 90% lean,
        male average 80%, female 70%.)
   </ul>
   </p>
<li> Residuals of metobolic data
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li> Use fit model.  Then use $ to save the residuals.
    <li> Look for patterns--men vs. women (click on men in the
         histogram of men and all men will flash in the residual
	 plot.)
    <li> Look at histogram of residuals
    </ul>
    </p>
