<h1>Intelligent design</h1>


<h2>Possible rules for class</h2>
<ul>
<li> No appeal to authority for model building
	<ul>
	<li> talk about things we have read in class
	<li> talk about data collected by others
	<li> talk about personal models that you are willing to claim
		as your own
	</ul> 
<li> tell "off task" story.  I'll interupt of we are off task.
<li> God and religion are both "off task."
<li> This is a science/statistics course.  Data and models rule.  We
will spend most of the time discussing models and just enough data to
help elminate some of the models.
</ul>

<h2>Readings</h2>
<ul>
<li> Greg Egan: story from Axiomatics
<li> Diskworld thing story about humious creators
</ul>

<H2>Outline</h2>

<ul>
<li> Introduction
    <ul>
    <li> Certificate of design: blue prints
    	<ul>
    	<li> Try to get prints for fancy library
    	<li> DNA is blue print of life
    	<li> So no question that life was designed
    	<li> Question is, was it intelligent
    	<li>
    	<li>
    	</ul>
    <li> Rational vs intelligent
    	<ul>
    	<li> economic defintion of rational = maximizing
    	<li> Unfortunately, there is no good definition of intelligent
    	<li> We will take intelligence to be the ability to solve
    		problems, but which problem does it try to solve?  And
		how good is it at solving those problems?
	<li> We will assume that any designer is at least as smart as
		a human
    	<li> A variety intelligence exists:
    		<ul>
    		<li> rational (smart and maximizing)
    		<li> artistic (generates symetry, and pretty patterns)
    		<li> lazy (reuse previuos designs rather than finding
    			correct one)
    		<li> sufficing (just good enough to get the job done)
    		<li> humorious (works on generating a good laugh, see
			Douglas Adams)
    		<li> imitative (imitates other designers or
			methodologies) 
    		</ul>
    	</ul>
    <li> Static vs. dynamic behaviours
	<ul>
	<li> Static is built and ignored (Eg the pyramids)
	<li> dynamic requires continuous maintenance (eg Mininasota
		roads) 
	</ul>
    <li> Evolution:  Generate and test.
    	<ul>
    	<li> An algorithm not a variety of intelligence
    	<li> a well specified process
	<li> But not very good at solving problems
    	</ul>
 </ul>
<li> Cryptography, security and DNA
	<ul>
	<li> Simple subsitution cipher
		<ul>
		<li> Using generate and tests it takes n! time to decypher it
		<li> Size of n is important: table of bits vs CPU time to
			crack
		<li> US governments DSA = 54 bits (check name and
			bits)
		</ul>
	<li> The code of life
		<ul>
		<li> Using permutation on 21 alphabets > 60 bits
		<li> Describe cipher 
		</ul>
	<li> Benefits: Avoids all cross species virus
		<ul>
		<li> AIDS (jumped species)
		<li> CJF? (or is this truely a prion?)
		<li> several Influenza's
		<li> malaria (needs to work in both humans and
			mosquitos) Is this a virus?
		</ul>
	<li> Costs: takes a bit more work to implement
	<li> Ramifacations
		<ul>
		<li> Each species could be identified by its code
		<li> If Great Danes and toy poddles can't physically
			mate, we could still tell if they were the
			same species by checking their DNA code
		<li> There is an audit trail of any species generated
			by evolution.  These species all would have
			the same DNA code.
		</ul>
	<li> Which intelligences would use this code?
    		<ul>
    		<li> rational: definitely yes
    		<li> artistic: doesn't care
    		<li> lazy:  easy enough that even lazy would use it
    		<li> sufficing: maybe
    		</ul>
	<li> Homework: What if you used L vs D amino-acids.  Avoids
		all baterological cross species infections.
	</ul>

<li> Sexual selection: 
	<ul>
	<li> 
	</ul>
<li>
	<ul>
	<li> 
	</ul>
</p>
<li> Conclusions
	<ul>
	<li> The standard model:
		<ul>
		<li> evolution generated all life (over a period of
			several billion years)
		<li> humans are a small step away from the animals
		<li> There is no intelegent design
		<li> predictions: see courses on evolution.  Read
			Dawkin's / Dennet.
		</ul>
	<li> One young earth model:
		<ul>
		<li> All animals are designed by an intellegent
			designer less than a million years ago
		<li> This designer is best modelled by saying it is
			 lazy, sufficing and imitative
			(i.e. non-rational)
		<li> need more conditions before predictions that
			differ from standard model can be made
		</ul>
	<li> Common physicist view: (called "The Anthromophic Principle")
		<ul>
		<li> Static design done at big bang.   (i.e. no
			involvement since then by the designer)
		<li> biologists explain biology, so if they say
			evolution is good enough, no need to get
			involoved. 
		<li> (minority position: selection bias generated
			intelligence.)
		<li> minority position predicts: we are alone in the
			universe. 
		</ul>
	<li> Active designer (typically believed to be an ET.  See
		David Birn's books about "Uplifting.")
		<ul>
		<li> evolution generated all animals, plants, etc
			except for humans. 
		<li> Assumption: intelligence (like humans have) is
			difficult to evolve and hence doesn't happen
			without guidence
		<li> careful breading over several million years
			turned apes/chimps into humans.
		<li> Prediction: it will take millions of years to
			breed dogs to be intelligent and learn to
			speak. 
		</ul>
	</ul>
