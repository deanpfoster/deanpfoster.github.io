<center><h1>  Statistics 541: Randomization </h1></center>


<H2>Admistrivia</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Any questions on the homework
  <li> Importance of statistics: Keeping people from overstating their
       claims.  Like a "blessing."  So wider is better, less
       significant is better since they are more likely to be
       correct. 
</ul>

<h2> Randomization</h2>

<h3> The Ecological fallacy</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Before the "blocks" project we did "find your own data" projects.
  <li> People found census data on states
  <li> Y = murders, X = education, Y positively related to X
  <li> Its negatively related if you add % urban.  But its positively
       related if you add %urban, and income. 
  <li> Bummer--we should outlaw education instead of handguns!
  <li> Draw several pictures of how X could be related to Y
</ul>

<h3> Observational studies</h2>

<ul>
  <li> (AZ library project yet again) Suppose 15 out of 200 librarians
       do the "new reading program."
  <li> X = 1 if new, 0 if old, Y = reading level of students
  <li> This is better than the state-by-state level analysis since at
       least the covariates have to be within each subject
  <li> Start controling in a regression sense is the only way
  <li> Once we add "ordering books for new reading program" we will
       get an infinate SE on our variable of X of interest
  <li> (This is as it should be!)
  <li> So people leave such variables out
</ul>

<h3>Intutive analysis of a multiple regression</h3>
<ul>
  <li> People look at a multiple regression and see all the choices
       that are made
  <li> They say to themselves, couldn't they have done many other
       regressions before they found this one?
  <li> So people intuitively do Bonferonni and ignore such studies
  <li> Hence people can't publish them and can't do them 
</ul>
<h3>Controlled experiments</h3>
<ul>
  <li> By only doing Y vs X we eliminate the "intuitive Bonferonni
       problems."
  <li> But, we have all the X --> Z --> Y like diagrams
  <li> So randomize assignment, now X is independent of Z FOR ALL Zs!
  <li> Ok, not all.  We have anything that is post randomization could
       be an interesting Z.
  <li> Hence don't tell the subjects (called single blind).
  <li> But merely telling say teachers/doctors that group A are
       treated and group B are untreated is enought for group A to get
       better results
  <li> So don't tell the doctors (called double blind).
</ul>
