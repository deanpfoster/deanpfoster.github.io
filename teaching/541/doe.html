<h2> Design Of Experiments</h2>

<h3>Do students give higher evaluations in the morning?</h3>
Suppose we are interested in whether students give higher class
evaluations in the morning than in the afternoon.  (Theory is based on
anectodotal studies.)  How can we test this claim?

<ul>
  <li> Exp 1: Abba teaches morning classes for next 10 years.  Bob
       teaches afternoon classes for next 10 years.  n=30, m=30.
  <li> Exp 2: Abba does 5 years in morning (while Bob does 5 years in
       afternoon) then then switches with Bob. n = 30, m =30.
  <li> Alternative theory: n = 2, m = 2.  (Maybe Bob is completely
       tiard after his noon bike ride and hence doesn't teach well in
       the afternoon.)
  <li> Exp 3: Abba teaches both morning and afternoon classes each
       semester.  So does Bob, Charles, Dean, Edward, Fred, George.
       Look at bob_afternoon - bob_morning and abba_afternoon -
       abba_morning.  One sample: n = 7. 
  <li> Alternative theory: morning students grade easier than
       afternoon students.
       <ul>
	 <li> Aside: do we care?
	 <li> Under this theory we would still choose to teach in the
	      morning.
	 <li> BUT, the deparmtnet can't do it on mass since that will
	      drive the afternoon students to the morning.
       </ul>
  <li> Exp 4: Randomly assign students to classes.  Solves all
       problems but practical ones!  (Ethics, scheduling conflects,
       adminstration not liking it.) n = 1000s. m = 1000s.
  <li> So what are the control variables of the deparment?  When
       classes are taught.
  <li> Exp 5: Run only morning classes for 5 years, then run only
       afternoon classes for 5 years.  See difference.
  <li> Alternative theory: Students are getting grumpier/easier with
       time.
  <li> Exp 6: Randomly decide each semester to run only morning
       classes or only afternoon classes.  See difference.  For 10
       years we would get an n=10, m=10.
</ul>
<h2>Handout on DOE</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Key items in design
       <ul>
	 <li> H0, H1  as science
	 <li> Xs, Ys
	 <li> what is a "row"?
	 <li> randomization, controls, data collection
	 <li> models
	 <li> H0, H1  as statistics
	 <li> n
	 <li> bad things: missing data, costs, time, interium analysis
	      for stopping
       </uL>
  <li> Some examples
       <ul>
	 <li> plan, model, key statistical question
       </ul>
  <li> Rogaine vs. Gro-againe
       <ul>
	 <li> Science: prevention of balding
	 <li> what to measure?
	 <li> units of analysis.  Parts of heads, or whole heads?
	 <li> randomization/data collection
	 <li> statistical hypothesis (beats rogaine, equal to or
	      different than?)
	 <li> Missing data.  Bored with poor results, moving out of
	      area, etc.
       </ul>
</ul>
<h2> Sample size calculations</h2>
<ul>
  <li> signficance, power, sample size, signal/noise are key
       properties
  <li> Goal: determine sample size from other items
  <li>  One sample problem
       <ul>
	 <li> Alpha says how far away x-bar has to be to be
	      significant
	 <li> Beta for some delta says how far away x-bar has to be
	      from interesting point
	 <li> n determines ratio of two scales
	 <li> Ah, now the details begin
       </uL>
</ul>
