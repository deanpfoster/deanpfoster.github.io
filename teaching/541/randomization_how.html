<center><h1>  Statistics 541: Randomization (How To) </h1></center>


<H2>Admistrivia</h2>

<ul>
  <li> no homework this week (yea!)
</ul>

<h3>As treated vs intent to treat</h3>
<ul>
  <li> doesn't it make more sense to look at those who get the drugs?
  <li> Called "as treated" (obviously named by the evil empire!)
  <li> Average treated - average untreated is hopelessly biased
  <li> Suppose you have three types:
       <ol>
	 <li> always takers
	 <li> never takers
	 <li> proper subjects (as assigned takers)
       </ol>
  <li> Then we can try to estimate the third group
</ul>

<h3>Controlled experiments/random sampling</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Chase down some goats
  <li> 100 mice are in a cage, pick 50 for treatment, leave remaining
       50 for control
  <li> Slow goats/mice are sampled!
  <li> Must use randomization device
</ul>

<h3>Blocking</h3>
<ul>
  <li> JMP will generate random Bernulli trials
  <li> Problem with Bernuilli trials is that they are independent.
  <li> You might get everyone under treatment!
  <li> Better is to use a multinomial (fancy word for pulling cards
       from a deck without replacement)
</ul>

<h3>Stratification</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Blocking for treatment vs control, why not also block for male
       vs female?
  <li> Called stratification.
  <li> Good idea: but male/female, young/old, black/white,
       healthy/sick.  Now we have one person per cell.
  <li> Talk to doctor to see what is likely to be important and
       control for the single most important issue.
</ul>
<h3>Non-stratification approaches</h3>
<ul>
  <li> What if you want to control for 10 things?
  <li> You need at least 1024 subjects!
  <li> If you use 11 subjects and regression you are fine.  (Ok, 40 would be more realistic)
  <li> So do a multiple regression on things you want to control for
  <li> Just don't tell anyone!  Call it "adjusted" or something else
  <li> Note: Toxicity can't be used as a covariate.  Why?
</ul>
<h3>Some math on efficiency</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Controling ahead of time doesn't cost a degree of freedom
  <li> Controling afterward costs a degree of freedom
  <li> No bigee-if you have at least 50 observations.  Bigee if you have only 10 observations. 
</ul>
