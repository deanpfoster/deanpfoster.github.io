The data for problems in Myers' "Classical and Modern Regression with
Applications" are given according to chapter number in the filename's
first extention and question number in the second extention.
For example, Chapter 2, problem 7 is given the name PROB2.7.  Each
file has column headings for the variable name and variable values are
organized accordingly.  Any of these files may be viewed with the
DOS TYPE command (for example, TYPE A:PROB2.7).
 
In order to use the file, you will typically need to use a text
editor such as EDLIN in DOS (or one of many word processors) to
delete the variable names so that the data may be read correctly.
Check the documentation to the statistics software you are using for
relevant details.
