<H2>Admistrivia</h2>

<ul>
<li> Read section 7.4
<li> Questions about the project? (suggested due date: next tuesday)
<li> Sure there aren't any question?
<li> Really no questions?
<li> Positive?
  </ul>

<h2> Logistic</h2>

Suppose Y is discrete (binary response) and X is one or more
continuous variable(s).  We want to write P(Y) as a function of X
beta.  This violates any sense of linear regression--so how do we
proceed? Logistic regression uses P(Y) = logit(X beta).  But why is
this at all reasonable?
<p>
<h2> Normal distribution motivation</h2>
  Consider a simple regression of Y (binary) on X (continuous).
<ul>
  <li> Think of the joint distribution
  <li> Three ways of thinking about it:
       <ul>
	 <li> P(Y,X)
	 <li> P(Y|X)
	 <li> P(X|Y)  (this one we have done already)
       </ul>
  <li> So suppose X|Y is normal
  <li> We have a two sample t-test situation (simple linear regression
       with one binary regressor.)
  <li> So, working this this model, compute P(Y|X)
  <li> Or more easilly, the odds ratio P(Y=1|X)/P(Y=0|X) = exp(alpha +
       beta X)
  <li> Oops: Slope isn't 1/diference in means but is difference in
       means itself!
  <li> Can this possibly be correct?
  <lI> Ok, graphically it is fine--but does it make any sense
</ul>

<h2>Regression slopes review</h2>
<ul>
  <li> slope of Y|X = beta
  <li> slope of X|Y = gamma
  <li> if Y|X increases does gamma increase or decrease?
       <ul>
	 <li> decreases: Scale Y by a factor r.  Then beta --> r beta
	      and gamma -> gamma/r. 
	 <li>  increases: slope is cov/var.  So if beta increases, the
	      covaraince increases and hence gamma increases
	 <li> Oops: that doesn't help
       </ul>
  <li> SD line: ratio of SD(y)/SD(x).  Truely the best fit line!
  <li> Keeping the SD line constant, the slopes are identical.
  <li> This is what is happening in the logistic regression problem
</ul>

<h2>Interpretation of the wrong-way two-sample t test model</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Slope of logistic regression measures how far about the two
       distributions are 
  <li> Different variances --> add a quadratic term
  <li> Doesn't make sense if X is an outlier
  <li> p-values should be identical (or at least close)
</ul>

</ul>
