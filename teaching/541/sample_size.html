<h2> Sample size calculations</h2>

<h3> Simulating an experiment</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Need to simulate a whole experiment in our heads
  <li> Suppose we are testing H<sub>0</sub>: mu = 0 vs. H<sub>1</sub>: mu > 0
  <li> Collect n samples, compute X-bar, SD(X-bar) = sigma/sqrt(n)
  <li> Draw pictures under null and under alternative
  <li> Rejection region defines alpha
  <li> Acceptance region defines beta under alternative
  <li> Goal:
       <ul>
	 <Li> want mu to be small so we can detect subtle differences
	 <li> want alpha to be small so no type I errors
	 <li> want beta to be small so no type II errors
	 <li> want n to be small so we don't have to collect much data
       </ul>
  <li> Problem:  ALL of these are playing agisnst each other
</ul>

<h3>Picking n</h3>
The one sample problem.  Is x-bar signficantly larger than a specified null value?
<ul>
  <li> Alpha says how far away x-bar has to be to be significant
  <li> Beta for some delta says how far away x-bar has to be from interesting point
  <li> Draw picture on Z-scale
  <li> Put "real" scale underneath it
  <li> n determines ratio of two scales
  <li> Ah, now the details begin
       <ul>
	 <li> delta = mu - mu<sub>0</sub>
	 <li> Z<sub>alpha</sub> = required significance (alpha)
	 <li> Z<sub>beta</sub> = required power (beta)
	 <li> Key equation: |Z<sub>alpha</sub>| + |Z<sub>alpha</sub>| = delta/SE
	 <li> n = sigma<sup>2</sup> (|Z<sub>alpha</sub>| + |Z<sub>alpha</sub>|)<sup>2</sup>/delta<sup>2</sup> 
       </ul>
</ul>

Easier problem: Find n to work with a confidence interval.  n =
|Z<sub>alpha</sub>| sigma<sup>2</sup> /(Interval width)<sup>2</sup>.
Depending how you define width, you many need a factor of 2 in here
also.

<h3>Picking all values</h3>
Need to pick all parameters.
<ul>
  <li> Draw up table of type I and type II error
  <li> specify delta via economics (smallest profitable difference)
  <li> put costs on each error cell
  <li> If null is true, want small alpha, if alternative is true want
       small beta, unfortunately, this would be self-confirming EVEN if it
       weren't correct.
  <li> Scientific tradition: alpha = .05, beta = .1 or beta = .2
  <li> economic decisions are more difficult
       <ul>
	 <li> Example: to build a new plant or not
	      <ul>
		<li> if everything works, small profits
		<li> if not enough new jobs, large loss
		<li> Must protect null (alpha very small)
	      </ul>
	 <li> Example: eliminate night shift to cut down on breakdowns
	      <ul>
		<li> if alternative true, big wins
		<li> if alternative shown untrue, we missed a few overtime jobs
		<li> more symetric (alpha approximately = beta, both not too small)
	      </ul>
       </ul>
  <li> Now solve for n
</ul>
