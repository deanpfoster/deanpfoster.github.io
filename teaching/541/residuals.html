<center><h1>  Statistics 541: Residuals </h1></center>


<H2>Admistrivia</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Homework: Do Myers' problem: 3.20 (on page 160, <a href="homework_epa.txt">data</a>).  
       Also give me a histogram of the residuals.
  <li> Read all of chapter 5.
</ul>

<h2> Residuals (chapter 5 of Myers)</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Which residuals?
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Y - Y-hat: don't have the same variance under ideal
	      circumstances.  They aren't independent either!  
	 <li> (Y - Y-hat)/SD(Y - Y-hat) called studentized residuals:
	      normalizes to common scale.
	 <li> Leave one out statistics: remove the data point--run the
	      regression and refit and standardize.  Luckilly no need
	      for doing all this work--its the same as the studentized
	      residual!  (related to PRESS = Prediction Sum of
	      Squares)
	 <li> Use variance with value or not?  CAlled externally
	      studentized or R-student.  Has a known distribution:
	      t<sub>n-p-1</sub>.
       </ul>
       <p>
  <li> Using regression to test outliers
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Did TMI affect the price of GPU? <a href="events.csv">csv</a>
	 <li> Need a Bonferroni correction if you don't know the cause
	      of the outlier.
       </ul>
       <p>
  <li> Using regression to test for curvature
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Is there a non-linear effect caused by X?
	 <li> Test it by putting in X<sup>2</sup>.
       </ul>
       <p>
  <li> Histogramming the residuals
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> outliers
	 <li> normality
       </ul>
       <p>
  <li> Plotting residuals vs Y-hat
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Feel good plot
	 <li> shows off R-sq
	 <li> Might suggest need to transform Y
       </ul>
       <p>
  <li> Plotting residuals vs X's
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> curvature
	 <li> hetroskadasticity
       </ul>
       </p>
  <li> Plotting residuals vs partial regression
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> X-axis is X regressed on all other variables
	 <li> Shows leverage effects
	 <li> slope is partial slope in regression
       </ul>
       </p>
</ul>
