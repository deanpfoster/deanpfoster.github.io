<H2>Admistrivia</h2>

<ul>
<li> Any project questions?
<li> ERROR IN BOOK: page 324 the d.f. for the chi-squared is wrong.
     it should be k instead of n-k-1.
<li> No questions after class--got to run to a talk
</ul>

<h2> Logistic Regression 2</h2>


<h2>Car example</h2>
Claim: Cars from Japan are "under powered."
<ul>
  <li> <a href="car89.jmp">Car data</a>.
  <li> Predict Japan (origin = 3) from HP.
  <li> Same as predicting HP from "origin"
  <li> What if you want to control for the size of the car?
  <li> Interested in t-test from multiple regression
  <li> Again--either regression is fine
       <ul>
	 <li> HP regressed on size,origin is Origin significant?
	 <li> Origin regressed on size,HP is HP significant?
       </ul>
  <li> Why not control for lots of stuff?  So, drop in more variables.
</ul>
