<H2>Admistrivia</h2>

<ul>
  <li> My grandmother (who is 99) is in the hospital--so I might miss
       some days.  I'll try to send in a replacement.
</ul>

<h2> Generalized Estimating Equations</h2>

General problem:  Observe the same person over time.  Say in medicine,
you might follow the effect of a drug.  I education you might follow
the effect of various teaching styles, or interactive learning
methods.  In business you might follow the course of various incentive
plans for sales people.
<p>
Assumption: each person is independent of all other people, but
depends highly on themselves.
<p>
Model:
<p>
Y = X beta + noise
<p>
But the noise is NOT independent.  But the dependence is not easilly
modelled.  Alternatively, you might not believe the model even if it
were easy to come up with.
<p>
Model notation:
<ul>
  <li> j<sub>ij</sub> ith person jth observation
  <li> i = 1..K
  <li> j = 1..n<sub>i</sub>  (or more easilly j = 1..n)
  <li> E.g. blood pressure measurement at 3 visits to doctor
  <li> There are X's also!  Need 3 indexes--but lets use vectors
  <li> x<sub>ij</sub> = vector of ith person jth observation covariates
  <li> see eqn for density and mean and variance
  <li> E(y) = a'(theta), var(y) = a''(theta)/phi
</ul>
Random effects example:
<ul>
  <li> corr(y<sub>it</sub>,y<sub>it'</sub>) = alpha
  <li> Eg y<sub>it</sub> = E(y) + epsilon<sub>i</sub> + epsilon<sub>it</sub>
  <li> covariance is capture in epsilon<sub>i</sub>
  <li> (example 3 in paper)
</ul>
Time series example:
<ul>
  <li> corr(y<sub>it</sub>,y<sub>it'</sub>) = alpha<sup>|t-t'|</sup>
  <li> eg: y<sub>it</sub> = AR(1) process (aka an OU process)
  <li> (example 4 in paper)
</ul>
