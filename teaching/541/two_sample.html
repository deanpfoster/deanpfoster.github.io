<center><h1>  Statistics 541: Two-Sample </h1></center>


<H2>Admistrivia</h2>

<ul>
<li> Give back homework
</ul>

<h2> Two sample t-test</h2>


<ul>
  <li> Scientific contex
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Suppose we compare two groups
	 <li> one typically called X other typically called Y.
	 <li> Or scientifically: control and treatment group
	 <li> EG: Do people with ACL replacements do "better" than
	      those without ACL replacement?
	 <li> interested in deciding which group is
	      better/larger/higher mean.
       </ul>
       </p>
  <li> How can we compare two group?
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Traditional answer: two sample t-test (keyword = pooled)
	 <li> Also called simple regression
	 <li> Let indicator represent each group
	 <li> Run regression of outcome on indicator variable 
       </ul>
       </p>
  <li> What if the two groups have different variances?
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Traditional answer: Welchs approximation (also large
	      sample) 
	 <li> Also called simple regression using the sandwich
	      estimator
	 <li> Done automatically by all statistical packages
       </ul>
       </p>
  <li> What if we take two measurement on each person?
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Traditional answer: paired t-test 
	 <li> Also called multiple regression
	 <li> First indicator called treatment (1=treatment,
	      0=control)
	 <li> Add one indicator for each person (called "row effect")
	 <li> Don't look at row effects, only at column effect
	 <li> Easy to represent in a table
       </ul>
       </p>
</ul>
<h2>ANOVA</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Scientific context
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Suppose we compare more than two groups
	 <li> EG: Which surgery is best, ACL reconstruction,
	      cadavorious replacement, none, Teflon replacment
	 <li> interested in deciding which group is best.
       </ul>
       </p>
  <li> How can we compare many groups?
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Traditional answer: one-way ANOVA
	 <li> Also called multiple regression
	 <li> have one indicator for each group (no constant)
	 <li> Multiple comparisons come up
       </ul>
       </p>
  <li> What if the two groups have different variances?
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Traditional answer: Oops, don't like doing that
	 <li> Easy with sandwich estimator
       </ul>
       </p>
  <li> What if we take several measurements on each person?
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Traditional answer: two way ANOVA (keyword randomized
	      block design)
	 <li> Also done as multiple regression
       </ul>
       </p>
</ul>

<h2>The interesting new issue is multiple comparisons</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Compare to grand mean (Bonferroni = sqrt(2 log p))
  <li> Compare all pairs (balanced design Bonferroni = 2 sqrt(2 log
       p), work out both ways of thinking about this)
  <li> Improvement: Tukey-Cramer, uses dependencies in situation and
       hence get a slight improvement over Bonferroni
  <li> Easier problem: HSU, uses the fact that we don't care which is
       best, only if each category COULD be best or not.
</ul>
