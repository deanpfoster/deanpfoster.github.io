<h2>Admistrivia</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Midterm this Wednesday
  <li> Questions from the homework?
</ul>

<h1>Multiplying matrixes</h1>
<ul>
  <li> Read section III.7 before next time
  <li> Submatrices: P = ((Q R) (0 I)).
  <li> How to multiply them out?
  <li> Cool fact: you can treat as 2x2 matrix.
  <li> P to power involves q to power a sum of q to powers
  <li> Review summing p-series.
</ul>
<h2>W = mean number of visits</h2>
<ul>
  <li> W = sum P<sup>i</sup>
  <li> For our matrix: one piece is "finite" the other is "infinite"
  <li> Save out the finite part: call it our W of interest
  <li> Expected number of visits to each state
  <li> Can be used to compute almost everything!
</ul>
<h2>Passing to the limit</h2>
<ul>
  <li> For the finite part, we can pass to the limit
  <li> W = I + QW
  <li> Interpret as a first step analyses (or n-squared first step analyses)
  <li> Give explicit solution: W = (1 - Q)<sup>-1</sup>
</ul>
<h2> Computing number of visits W</h2>
<ul>
  <li> W<sub>ij</sub> = E(number of hits to j starting from i)
</ul>
<h2>Computing hitting probabilities with W</h2>
<ul>
  <li> WR = hitting probabilities
  <li> Do as a first step analysis
</ul>
</h2>Computing last state before absorbtion with W</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Just change the matrix so the absorbing states keep track of
       the last state visited.
</ul>
