<h1>Review of probability</h1>

<h2>Admistrivia</h2>
<ul>
<li> Class web page:
   <ul>
    <li> Often has my lecture notes on it.  If there is too much math,
         I don't put it on line though.
    <li> Homeworks (due about once per week) and schedule.
    <li> Readings (I won't announce them in class since I forget).
   </ul>
<li> Pass out copy of main page.
<li> If you haven't seen probability in a while, read chapters 1 and 2
carefully.  Stop by and see me (or the TA) with anything you don't
understand.  This "review" will be kinda fast if it is new.
<li> I expect to spend 10 minutes a day on HW problems IF you ask me
questions--otherwise I'll just ignore the homework.
</ul>

<h2>Intro: What is a stochastic process anyway?</h2>
<ul>
<li> Example: google page rank and random web surfing
  <ul>
  <li> Pick a page at random.  Call it X<sub>0</sub>.  (Note: even
this step is hard.  Mathematically it requires numbering all the web
pages.)
  <li> Follow a link at random.  This is X<sub>1</sub>.
  <li> Follow a link at random.  This is X<sub>2</sub>.
  <li> Repeat.
  <li> Typical question: If X<sub>0</sub> = www.gosset.upenn.edu, what
is the chance that X<sub>1</sub> = www.library.upenn.edu?
  <li> Typical question: If X<sub>0</sub> = www.gosset.upenn.edu, what
is the chance that X<sub>2</sub> = www.library.upenn.edu?
  <li> What is the distribution of X<sub>1</sub>? X<sub>2</sub>?
X<sub>infinity</sub>?   (Called your page rank on google)
  <li> Let A = set of all pornography.  P(X<sub>4</sub> in
A|X<sub>0</sub> in wharton)?
</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Technical defiintion of stochastic process</h2>
<ul>
<li> What is a random variable? (map from sample space to real line)
<li> Definition is unimportant for only one RV, but if you have many
of them the definition matters.
<li> Example: X<sub>1</sub>,X<sub>2</sub>,...,X<sub>T</sub>.
<li> What is a stochastic process?
<ul>
    <Li> Just a indexed set of random variables!
    <li> Typically the index is time
    <li> examples: stock market, store purchase behavior, physics,
chemistry. 
</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Chapter 1: Review of probability</h2>
<ul>
<li> Expectation: E(g(X)).  Will contrast soon with conditional
expectation
<li> Poisson distribution: Start with Taylor series for expectation.
<ul>
<li> Note: expecation is a sum
</ul>
<li> Exponential distribution: Same parameter as poisson?!?
<ul>
<li> Note: expecation is now an integral
</ul>
</ul>
<h2>More details of conditional expectation and probability</h2>
<ul>
<li> P(A|B) basic definition
<li> Our usage will be like example page 58: work it out if time
<li> Simple definition of conditional expectation:
<ul>
<li> E(X|A) = E(XI<sub>A</sub>)/E(I<sub>A</sub>)
<li> Ok, that should make your head spin!
<li> Deconstruct it
<li> E(X|A) = E(XI<sub>A</sub>)/P(A)
</ul>
<li> Problem II.E.1.5 puts all this together
</ul>
<h2>Conditional expectation as a random variable</h2>
<ul>
<li> Conditional expectation as a random variable
<li> Smoothing lemma: E(g(X)) = E(E(g(X)|Y))
</ul>

<h2>Chapter 2: Conditional expectation and probability</h2>
<ul>
<li> P(A|B) basic definition
<li> Our usage will be like example page 58: work it out if time
<li> Simple definition of conditional expectation:
<ul>
<li> E(X|A) = E(XI<sub>A</sub>)/E(I<sub>A</sub>)
<li> Ok, that should make your head spin!
<li> Deconstruct it
<li> E(X|A) = E(XI<sub>A</sub>)/P(A)
</ul>
<li> Definition: E(g(X)|Y) 
<li> Smoothing lemma: E(g(X)h(Y)) = E[h(Y)E(g(X)|Y)]
<ul>
  <li> Very cool lemma!
  <li> Proof: 
  
</ul>
</ul>
