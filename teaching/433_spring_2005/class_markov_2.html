<h1>Chapter III: Markov chains</h1>

<h2>Admistrivia</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Readings: Chapter III up to page 112
  <li> Questions from the homework?
</ul>

<h2>Chapter III.2: Trasistion functions</h2>

<h3>Example from my <a href="../../research/index.html">research</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li> "Cooperation in the Short and in the Long Run," with H.P.  Young,
    <em> Games and Economic Behavior</em>, <strong> 3</strong>,
	(1991), 145 - 156.
      <ul>
         <li> Game theory
         <li> Prisoners Dilemma: Cooperate, defect, tit-for-tat
         <li> We built a model with these three types and modelled
	      evolution of them
         <li> Draw matrix
     </ul>
    <li> Interested in what happens several moves from now
    <ul>
      <li> Suppose start in T4T: where will be 2 moves from now?
      <li> Suppose start in T4T: where will be 10 moves from now?
      <li> Chapter 4 answers 1000 moves from now.
     </ul>
   <li> Very large sum
   <li> There is a better way
     <ul>
     <li> P(1 -> ? -> 3) = sum over all possiblilites
     <li> Write it out
     <li> Looks fimilar?  Row times column of P matrix
     </ul>
   <li> n-step transition is generated by multiplying matrixes
</ul>

<h3>Theorem: multiplying probabilities</h3>
<ul>
  <li> probability version of proof (concrete as in book)
  <li> uses "summing over disjoint events!"
</ul>
<h3>Example: 3 step transition of orginal example</h3>
<ul>
  <li> What is P^3?  (Gee you can do it on your modern calculators!)
</ul>
<h3>Section III.3: Models</h3>

<ul>
  <li> Inventory model: s,S policy (from OPIM)
  <li> Queueing model of the "The Greek Lady"
</ul>
