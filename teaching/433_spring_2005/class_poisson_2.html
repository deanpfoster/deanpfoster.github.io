<h2>Admistrivia</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Homework 8 due Monday.
  <li> Read p 279 - 286.
  <li> Mean = 83, SD = 9.
</ul>

<h1>Models</h1>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Some times it works, other times not:
    <ul>
    <li> Good model for bikers in triathelone.
    <li> Bad model for bikers in tour de france.
    <li> Why?
    </ul>
    <li> BUT: Triathelon's are a Nonhomogeneous process
       <ul>
       <li> lambda(t) instead of lambda is rate
       <li> E(X<sub>t+h</sub>-X<sub>t</sub>) = lambda(t)h
       <li> P(X<sub>t+h</sub>-X<sub>t</sub> = 1) = lambda(t)h
       <li> Example: Call board.
       </ul>
</ul>

<h1>Theorem V.2.1 (p 280): Coupling argument</h1>

THEOREM: Suppose,
<ul>
<li> epsilon<sub>i</sub> is bernoulli: P(epsilon<sub>i</sub> = 1) =
     p<sub>i</sub>.
<li> epsilon<sub>i</sub> are independent.
<li> S = sum epsilon<sub>i</sub>
</ul>
Then S is approximately poisson with mean = sum p<sub>i</sub>.  In
particular, the error is bounded by sum  p<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup>.

<h2>Proof</h2>
<ul>
<li> NOTE: If all p's are the same--this is the traditional poisson
approximation.  Just do it!
<li> Alternative proof: if n = 1, and p is small, Binomial = bernulli
= Poisson.  Now sum the Poissons to discover that S is approximately
Poisson.  But how accurate is this?
  <ul>
    <li> Each is off by p<sup>2</sup>
    <li> total error is off by np<sup>2</sup> = lambda p.
  </ul>
<li>What is going on in second proof?
  <ul>
    <li> Sequence of epsilons
    <li> Sequence of X's that approximate the epsilons
    <li> They are "coupled" to live on the same probability space.
         (New trick that we didn't know when I was a kid.)
    <li> sum X's = sum epsilon's unless at least one differ.
    <li> bound probability of at least one differing by sum
  </ul>
</ul>
