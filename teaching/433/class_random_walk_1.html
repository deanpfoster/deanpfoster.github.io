<h1>Chapter III.5.3: Random walk</h1>

<h2>Recall random walk definition</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Big matrix!  (q = move left, p = move right,  r = stay put)
</ul>
<h2>Random walk ruin probability</h2>
<ul>
  <li> First step analysis generates recursion
  <li> That is all there is to the theory--now just solve it
  <li> Good guessing is the traditional way of generating a solution!
  <li> But there is an alternative: Martingales!
     <ul>
       <li> Create a martingale that matches the first step analysis
       <li> If a bettor were betting--what would make it fold back on
	    itself?
       <li> Eg: The bettor wins $1 (with prob p) or loses $(p/q) (with
	    probability q).  He wins $1.  What should his next bet be
	    to land him right back where he was? Win $(q/p) vs lose $1. 
       <li> Let the state count the number of net winning bets of the 
	    bettor.
       <li> Label states by bet amount: (q/p)^i
       <li> Check that it is a martingale (don't forget the boundary!)
     </ul>
  <li> Now that we have a martingale what do we do with it?
     <ul>
       <li> Where will X<sub>T</sub> be for large T?  (Markov chains
	    tell us it will be at one of the absorbing states)
       <li> What is the expected value of X<sub>T</sub>? (Martingales
	    tell us it is X<sub>0</sub>)
       <li> Solve the resulting equation and we are done!
     </ul>
  <li> Maybe guessing the solution isn't so bad after all
  <li> (q/p)<sup>i</sup> - (q/p)<sup>n</sup>)/(1 - (q/p)<sup>n</sup>)
</ul>

<h2>Understanding the equation itself</h2>
<h3>Graph</h3>
<ul>
  <li> plot fall off for the 3 cases: p < q, p > q, p = q.
</ul>
<h3>Large n</h3>
<ul>
  <li> What if n is really really large?
  <li> Easy to compute limit.
</ul>

<h2>Success runs processes</h2>
<ul>
  <li> "double or nothing"
  <li> Failure goes back to beginning
  <li> Called renewal process
</ul>
