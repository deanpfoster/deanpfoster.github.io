<h1>Chapter III: Markov chains</h1>

<h2>Admistrivia</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Questions from the homework?
</ul>

<h2>Chapter III.1: Defns</h2>

<h3>Markov process</h3>
<ul>
	<li> almost "memory less"
	<li> or better--only short term memory
	<li>
P(X<sub>t</sub>|X<sub>1</sub>,X<sub>2</sub>,...X<sub>t-1</sub>) = 
P(X<sub>t</sub>|X<sub>t-1</sub>)
<li> Much stronger than martingale since probabilities fully describe
the world
</ul>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<ul>
	<li> the market (even stochastic volitility models are Markov)
	<li> good marketing decisions
	<li> quantum mechanics
	<li> populations (both humans and viruses)
	<li> genetics
	<li> Human speach understanding
</ul>
<h3>Transition probability</h3>

P<sub>ij</sub> = Probability of i --> j
<ul>
  <li> matrix of probabilities
  <li> Along with a starting distribution FULLY describes the world
(Theorem at end of class)
  <li> Just keep multiplying up to get probably of any sequence
</ul>
<h3>Rows sum to one</h3>

Probability of starting in i and going anywhere.  Hence law of total
probabiltiy applies.

<h3>Infinite matrixes!?!</h3>
<ul>
<li> Why? Populations for example are most easilly modeled as being
unbounded.
<li> Difficult to draw--easy to notate
<li> Natural to consider only a piece of matrix and end up with "sub
probabilities." 
</ul>

<h3>Theorem: multiplying probabilities</h3>

<ul>
  <li> probability version of proof (concrete as in book)
  <LI> proof called first step analysis
</ul>
