<center><h1>  Statistics 433: Introduction to stochastic processes </h1></center>

<p>
<UL>
  <li> Description:
<p>
This course is to be a basic introduction to
       stochastic processes.  The primary focus will be on Markov
       chains both in discrete time and in continuous time.  By
       focusing attention on Markov chain,
       we can discuss many interesting models (from physics to
       economics).  Topics covered
       include: stable distributions, birth-death processes, Poisson
       processes, time reversibility, random walks, Brownian motion
       and Black-Scholes.

  <li> Prerequisites:
       <ul>
	 <li> Stat 430.
	 <li> or permission of instructor.
       </ul>
  <li> Spring 2004 will be the first time this course is taught.

  <li> Instructor: Dean Foster.
<li> Book: Introduction to Stochastic modeling, by Taylor and
       Karlin, 3rd edition.
  <li> Work load: This course will be driven primarily by problems.
       Hence there will be problem sets due weekly.
       <ul>
	 <li> Homework = 30%  (possibly including some computing / simulations)
	 <li> Midterm = 30%
	 <li> Final = 40%
