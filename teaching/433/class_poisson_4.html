<title>Stat 433: Chapter V.4: The uniform distribution</title>
</head>

<body>
<h2>Admistrivia</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Read 297-305
  <li> Read V.3 on your own.
    <ul>
    <li> Gamma distribution for waiting times
    <li> exponential distribution for inter-arrival times
    <li> Binomial distribution for Xs|Xt
    </ul>
</ul>

<h1>Relationship to the uniform distribution</h1>
<h2>Approximation</h2>

Story:
<ul>
  <li> Pick up n darts and throw them at interval of length t
  <li> Look at picture.  Looks like a Poisson process.
  <li> Each spot is equally likely (work out P(N(t,t+h)=1))
  <li> no spot has two darts (work out P(N(t,t+h)>1))
  <li> But not independent.
     <ul>
     <li> Divide into intervals
     <li> work out probably 
     <li> Ends up with slight negative dependency
     </ul>
</ul>
Amazing fact:
<ul>
  <li> If you pick up a poisson number of darts then counts are independent!
  <li> P(X,Y) = P(X,Y|N)P(N) ends up with independent Poissons
  <li> We don't "care" that they are Poissons--the independence is
       enough to show we have a poisson point process
</ul>
<h2>Theorem</h2>
Interpret the above differently and we get:
<p>
THEOREM: f(w1,w2,...,wn|N(t)=n) = n!t<sup>-n</sup>.
<p>
Proof:
<ul>
  <li> We can generate a Poisson process any way we like and it is the
same, so lets use our "poissonization" of a uniform distribution.
  <li> U<sub>1</sub> is where first dart landed, etc
  <li> W<sub>1</sub> is where left most dart, etc
  <li> Given N(t)=n, the U's are uniform.
  <li> But, the W's are NOT uniform!  (P(W<sub>1</sub> < t/2) > 1/2)
  <li> But all we lose is the order--hence the n!.
</ul>

<h2>Example 1: NPV of Poisson payments</h2>

<h3>By the book</h3>

M = E(sum exp(-beta W<sub>k</sub>))
<p>


<h2>Example 2: Shot noise</h2>

I(t) = sum h(t - W<sub>k</sub>)

<p>

Obviously, same if you use a Poisson number of U's.  But that is
easier to work with.


<h2>Time permitting: do details</h2>

    <ul>
    <li> Gamma distribution for waiting times
    <li> exponential distribution for inter-arrival times
    <li> Binomial distribution for Xs|Xt
    </ul>
