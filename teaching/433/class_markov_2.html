<h1>Chapter III: Markov chains</h1>

<h2>Admistrivia</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Readings: Chapter III up to page 112
  <li> Questions from the homework?
</ul>

<h2>Models</h2>

<h3>Example from my <a href="../../research/index.html">research</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li> "Cooperation in the Short and in the Long Run," with H.P.  Young,
    <em> Games and Economic Behavior</em>, <strong> 3</strong>,
	(1991), 145 - 156.
      <ul>
         <li> Game theory
         <li> Prisoners Dilemma: Cooperate, defect, tit-for-tat
         <li> We built a model with these three types and modelled
	      evolution of them
         <li> Draw matrix
     </ul>
    <li> Interested in what happens several moves from now
    <ul>
      <li> Suppose start in T4T: where will be 2 moves from now?
      <li> Suppose start in T4T: where will be 10 moves from now?
      <li> Chapter 4 answers 1000 moves from now.
     </ul>
   <li> Very large sum
   <li> There is a better way
     <ul>
     <li> P(1 -> ? -> 3) = sum over all possiblilites
     <li> Write it out
     <li> Looks fimilar?  Row times column of P matrix
     </ul>
   <li> n-step transition is generated by multiplying matrixes
</ul>

<h3>S,s model (see book for details)</h3>

<ul>
  <li> Inventory model: s,S policy (from OPIM)
  <li> inventory always decrease by amount purshased -- unless short
fall!
  <li> P(out of stock) = ???
  <li> E(X<sub>t</sub>) = ???
  <li> P(X<sub>t</sub> > X<sub>t-1</sub>) =
  <li> To "fix" first one, make s large
  <li> To "fix" second one make S small
  <li> to "fix" last one, make S-s small
  <li> Oops: can't do all three at once
</ul>
<h3>Genetics model (see book)</h3>
The book gives the details on a model very close to the one that
Peyton and I used above.

<h3>Queuing</h3>

<ul>
  <li> Queueing model of the "The Greek Lady"
  <li> Infinite queues as model
  <li> If arrival rate is higher than service rate--it grows with time
  <li> X<sub>t</sub> = (birth - death) t approximately
  <li> Queue drop out solves this
  <li> higher service rate solves this
</ul>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Many of these questions are about long run
  <li> X<sub>t</sub> not only object of focus
  <li> All these questions can be solved via first step analysis!
</ul>
