<title>Stat 433: Chapter IV.2: Models</title>
</head>

<body>
<h2>Admistrivia</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Midterms look great!
  <li> Read p 215 - 223.
</ul>

<h1>Models</h1>
<h2>Double stochastic</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Row sums and column sums are both 1
  <li> What is the stationary distribution? Uniform!
  <li> Generalization of "reversable"
  <li> All of physics is reversable
  <li> Hence: the world will evolve to a uniform distribution
  <li> Strong links to 2nd law of thermodynamics	
</ul>

<h2>2 step Markov instead of 1 step</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Build in history
  <li> Simple model of depression: Happy, Sad.
  <li> If "sad" twice in row, much more likely to be "sad" following
       time.
  <li> We could call this a new name "depressed".
  <li> Fraction happy is (H,S) + (H,H).  NOTE: this is the same as
       (H,H) + (H,S).
</ul>
<h2>Sampling plans</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Two manufacturing policies:
     <ul>
      <li> cross fingers and hope for the best
      <li> sample every item and fix those that are broken
     </ul>
  <li> Each has its advantages
  <li> But, doing the wrong one is an expensive mistake
  <li> How about we dynamically switch back an forth?
  <li> Model:
    <ul>
    <li> Each item has probability p of being defective
    <li> We will switch from sampling at rate 1/r, to complete
         sampling.
    <li> One defective --> switch to complete sampling
    <li> k nondefectives --> switch to random sampling
    <li> What does the limiting behavior look like?
    <li> Sampling increase as defects increase
    <li> Maximum error rate is bounded
    <li> All can be exactly computed (see page 218-220)
    </ul>
</ul>
