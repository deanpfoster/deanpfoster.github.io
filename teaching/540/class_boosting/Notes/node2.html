<P>
These ``S-Plus'' routines are infact interfaces to stand alone code,
developed to do heavy-weight scientific computing; linear algebra,
optimization etc.
<P>
There are propretiary  software suites available for these tasks -
two popular ones being IMSL and NAG. However, if you want to put these
routines in your code and re-distribute it, then you should check the
license carefully.
<P>
The alternative is to obtain free routines, just like those built into S-Plus.
The place to go is <TT>NETLIB</TT>. It's like  <TT>STATLIB</TT> but for
mathematical software. NETLIB is the ``mother-load''.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00021000000000000000">How to bring your ``real code'' into S-Plus</A></H2>
<P>
One of the key features of a decent environment is that it should
be extensible. S-Plus allows you to import your own source.
The commands to do this are <TT>.C</TT> and <TT>. Fortran</TT>.
<P>
There are 2 main reasonsfor wanting to do this.
<P>
1. Sloth - why re-invent the wheel, especially if someone has made
a better one than you can.
<P>
2. Speed - S-Plus is interpreted, it's very slow. It's great for fast
proto-typing but a disaster for really memory hogging, large jobs. Linking
to compiled code outside S-Plus can speed up execution 100 times.
<P>
We'll have a look at some examples of bringing code into S-Plus.
