<P>
<B> Objective</B>
Allow a remote user to perform prediction on
a binary outcome variable, using a set of covariates. 
Use both logistic regression and a neural network for the prediction
to allow a comparison of results.
<P>
Prediction should be done out of sample, that is on the validation dataset.
<P> Make sure that your procedure works on the dataset found in
<BR>
<TT>
http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~waterman/DataSets/class_06.data
</TT>

<P>
<b> Deliverables (by 3/4/99):</B>
<UL>
<LI> An HTML interface page that allows a user to run both the
logistic regression (additive at this stage) 
and neural network. It must have an input
area in which the user identifies the URL of their dataset,
and chooses the number of nodes for the net.
<LI> A cgi perl script that receives the request, fetches the data, runs the
R process and returns the results. Results should be in the form of two 
tables for the out of sample predictions.
<LI> Thought question: consider how you might identify areas in the
covariate space in which predictions differ between the two methods.

Additional comments added 2/27/99.

I've cleaned up the trial data set to be used for testing your
code on. It's called "new.uva" and is a tab delimited text file.
The URL is <TT>"http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~waterman/DataSets/new.uva"</TT><P>
Please put your interface page in 
<BR>
<B><TT>/home/username/public_html/Stat540s99/homework07/interface.html</TT></B>
<BR> and the Perl script in
<BR>
<B><TT>/home/username/public_html/cgi-bin/homework07.pl</TT></B>
<P>
Remember to rescale, to (0,1), the <B><TT>age</TT></B>
 variable before you use it in
the net. In general, you will need to be able to identify the
continuous predictor variables so you can rescale them. 
Use the command <TT>is.real</TT>  to do this.
<P>
Don't forget that I have put a link to the 
<A HREF="../class06/NnetHelp/00Index.html"> Neural nets help files. </A>
help pages.
<P>
As a matter of interest, here is the 
<A HREF="http://enkidu.wharton.upenn.edu/~waterman/Teaching/701f97/classnotes/class19/c19ssc.html">
S-Plus </A>code that I used to produce
the page of neural net 
<A HREF="http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~waterman/Teaching/701f98/nets/graphs.html">
graphics.</A> You can see how I constructed the perspective plots. Note that
parts of this code are out of date now, as I had the uva dataset labeled
differently when I wrote it, the file names differently and everything in
different locations! (But it's still a useful example.)
