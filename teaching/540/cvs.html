<H2>Admistrivia</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Most everyone got things to run
  <li> Problems included:
       <ul>
	 <li> incorrect perl address (hint: copy from my directory)
	 <li> permissions to tight (public can't read)
	 <li> permissions to lose (public can write)
	 <li> DOS file format (looking for the program /usr/bin/perl<cr>)
	 <li> Can't run from command line (any problem in code does this)
	 <li> Believing in a consistent world view (putting &le and &gr around html header)
       </ul>
</ul>

<h2> CVS</h2>

<ul>
  <li> logical programming vs experimental programming
       <ul>
	 <li> logical approach: use designed languages say ML, smalltalk
	 <li> For all others, use experimental approach
	 <li> Logical can be done with pencil and paper (some schools actually teach this way)
	 <li> experimental requires running lots of code 
       </ul>
  <li> Experimental programming methods
       <ul>
	 <li> Just like any other controled experiment
	 <li> sample size requirements aren't as high as for drug testing
	 <li> BUT, you do need to do controlled experiments
       </ul>
  <li> Primary tool of controlled experiment is a version control system
       <ul>
	 <li> Problem: there is more than one experiment you can do
	      <ul>
		<li> say running from the command line
		<li> running on sample input
		<li> running from web
		<li> checking colors
	      </ul>

	 <li> If you make a whole bunch of changes without running ALL
	      of your tests, you will find yourself with broken code
	 <li> you undo those changes to make a clean experiment
	 <li> CVS allows unlimited undo's
       </ul>
  <li> Picture of cvs tree (yikes!  Do we really need all of that?)
       (names: head, branch, tags, version number.)
  <li> Picture of single user cvs thread (ah, that makes more sense)
  <li> How to see the thread?
       <ul>
	 <li> Find a cvs gui (only for people born after 1980)
	 <li> The real way: use cvs commands
	 <li> "cvs log" shows tree
	 <li> "cvs diff" shows what has changed
	 <li> "cvs co -r1.4" rolls back to some previous time
       </ul>
  <li> Rules of experimental programming using CVS
       <ul>
	 <li> Check in frequently.  Write comments every time. (To get
	      your comments to appear in your file put in the
	      statement $log:$ into your file.)
	 <li> Start with simple working code (say hello world)
	 <li> Gradually modify that code to do what you want it to do
	 <li> When you discover it no longer works on the web, roll
	      back until it runs on the web
	 <li> Now look and see what you changed.  it should only be
	      about 5 lines.  figure out what went wrong in those 5
	      lines.  Patch them into the head.
	 <li> Check that the head works, and check it in.
       </ul>
  <li> Class rules:
       <p>
       If you have problems with your code, tell me between which
       versions the problem started.  There should only be a few lines
       of difference.  Email me the "cvs diff -r1.5 -r1.6" output and
       I'll see if I can figure out the problem.
</ul>
