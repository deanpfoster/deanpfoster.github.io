<H1> Homework 5. Stat 540.</H1>

<P> <b>Task</b>. Perl: Clean up master-mind to look pretty and save
information.  (In particular, make it as easy to use as possible.  For
example, you should be able to see your past guesses when you are
making your current guesses.)

<P>
<b>Task</b>. Familiarize yourself with R.

How?  
<UL>
<LI>Identify online resources related to R.  Add to your web page.

<LI> Read a set of commands from an input file and have R excecute them (use the <tt> source</tt> command).

<LI> Write output from R to a file (use the <tt>sink</tt> command).

<LI> Make sure you fire up R from a Perl script and read in an input file of R commands.

<LI> Consider how you might make your output from R more
"WEB" readable.
<BR>
Essentially, most R objects have a "print" method. 
For each object we care about returning to the user we will need to write
a print.html method, which will output in a format suitable for reading
over the WEB.
</UL>
<P>
<b>Task</b>. Familiarize yourself with gnuplot.
<ul>
  <li> start with "man gnuplot" and then use "help" inside gnuplot
  <li> Plot a few obvious functions
  <li> Plot x sin(1/x) for x between -1 and 1.  Try to control the plotting so that the graph looks correct.
  <li> Plot a dataset 
  <li> Label the graph with a caption and label the axis
</ul>
