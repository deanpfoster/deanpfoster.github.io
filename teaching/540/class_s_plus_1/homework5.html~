<H1> Homework 5. Stat 540.</H1>

<P>
<b>Task</b>. Perl and Splus task?  Clean up master-mind to look pretty and save information.

<P>
<b>Task</b>. Familiarize yourself with R.

How?  
<UL>
<LI>Identify online resources related to R.  Add to your web page.

<LI> Read a set of commands from an input file and have R excecute them (use the <tt> source</tt> command).

<LI> Write output from R to a file (use the <tt>sink</tt> command).

<LI> Make sure you fire up R from a Perl script and read in an input file of R commands.

<LI> Consider how you might make your output from R more
"WEB" readable.
<BR>
Essentially, most R objects have a "print" method. 
For each object we care about returning to the user we will need to write
a print.html method, which will output in a format suitable for reading
over the WEB.
