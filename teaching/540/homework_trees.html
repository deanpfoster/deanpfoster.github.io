<center><h1>  Homework on trees </h1></center>

The first part of this homework should be done in hard copy and the
second part by changing your web material. 

<ol>
  <li> Create a file called tree.pl and check it into your CVS
       system.  Every time you add a function to your file, checkin an
       updated version and add a comment to your CVS log describing
       the changes you made.
<p>
  <li> Implement a sorted binary tree (without balancing) in perl.  You should have functions
       that will
       <p>
       <ol type=a>
       <li> print the tree (in a pretty fashion showing the tree
       structure)
       <li> insert nodes into the tree
       <li> delete nodes from the tree
       <li> find if a number is already in the tree
       <li> find the greatest lower bound for a number
       is in the tree.
       <li> A function that will return how balanced the tree is
	    (definitions of balance vary.  Use what ever makes
	    sense to you.)
       <p>
	    </ol>
  <li> Randomly insert 20 items into the tree.  Print it out.  Is it
       balanced?  Now randomly insert and delete items for a great
       number of round.  Your goal is to come up with a strategy for
       generating an unbalanced tree.  After many rounds, print the
       state of the tree again.  How unblanced is it?  Run your
       simulation enought times to generate some statistics on the
       balance of the tree and the time for finding a random node in
       the tree.  
       <p>
  <li>  Implement a balanced binary tree.  
       <p>
  <li> Rerun your simulation using your balanced binary tree.  This
       should require only a very small modification to your code
       above.  If you are having to do lots of rewriting--you should
       have thought more the first time through!
       <p>
  <li> Write up (in LaTeX) a discussion of your results.  Describe
       your simulation well enough that I could redo it if I wanted to
       without having to read your perl code.  Describe the outcome of
       your simulation.  Discuss if you think balancing the binary
       tree is worth it or not. (Note: you can checkin latex files to
       CVS also.)
       <p>
  <li> Print a copy of your code.
       <p>
  <li> Print out your CVS log of tree.pl.
       <p>
</ol>

On a unrelated note, modify your mind-sweep game to have a "hint"
button.  The hint button should suggest a possible legal configuration
given all the information that is known up to this point.
<p>
Note: If you simply keep hitting the hint button over and over again,
you should end up with a correct solution.
<p>
Note: Next time we will make the hint smarter.
