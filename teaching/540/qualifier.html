<center><h1>  Computing qualifier question</h1></center>

<p>

This question will have you:
<ol>
<li> write a perl script that will gather data from the web,
<li> display this data on the web,
<li> and finally put the two steps together to create a dynamic
web page.
</ol>
     When you are done, you will have written a matching game
that is like the children's game called "concentration."  It could be
used as a memory aid to help students learn the faces of the faculty
members at Wharton.

<p>

<ol>
  <li>
       The first step will be to extract the data from a file.
       Download a copy of  
       <p>
       http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/fac_name.html
       <p>
       Write a regular expression that will match on the lines that
       describe each faculty member.  Describe why you believe this
       will match correctly without matching too many things it
       shouldn't.  If you follow the link from each person, you will
       also find a picture of that faculty member.  
       <p>
       Now write a perl script that will convert the file you
       downloaded into a csv file.  So the first line of output
       should be:
       <p>
       "Abel, Andrew B.","http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/abel.html", "http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/abel.gif"
       <p>
       What sorts of changes might Wharton make to the data that would
       make your program generate incorrect results?  You don't have
       to program to avoid these issues, simply you have to note that
       they exist.  This documentation will probably take more time to
       figure out and write than the program itself will.
  <li>
       Write a html form/perl script that will read in the file
       generated in the 
       first problem and randomly select 5 pictures to display.  Under
       each picture have 5 buttons that can be selected.  Each button
       should be labelled with the names of the faculty shown (in
       random order).
       <p>
       The user then picks one name from list and hits the submit
       button.  If all of the answers are correct, congratulate the
       user.  If there are any errors, tell the user the correct
       answer and provide a link to the faculty member's homepage.
<li>
     Now to put it all together.  Suppose a new faculty member joins
     Wharton.  The above setup won't include these new people
     in the game because it relies on static data.  So your problem
     is to figure out some way that they will be automatically
     included.  Implement
     this procedure.  (Feel free to write it from scratch in perl. Or
     you can use perl code downloaded from the web.  Or if you like
     you could use a cron job and something like wget.  The idea here
     is to complete the talk while writing as few lots of lines of
     code as possible.) 
  </ol>
