<P>
Now, the server receives this GET request. It fires up the program
(hello.pl) and returns the output, verbatim. But this description
fails to include exactly how the WEB page ends up  communicating with the
program. Communication requires a protocol or set of conventions, CGI
provides this convention. In particular, as we will see in the next
class, it describes how arguments should be passed to programs, and
provides the program with a set of Environment Variables, 
for example, the type of browser the initiator of the request was using,
the IP address of the initiator etc.
<P>
It's a common misconception that CGI is a ``programming
language''. CGI allows the WEB page and server to communicate with the 
program. In summary, CGI is the protocol which allows programs to be executed
over the WEB.
<P>
Today, we won't deal with CGI, because  we won't be using
environment variables and passing parameters to the program.
