<P>
We write WEB pages using  HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language).
<P>
Concept of a markup language - it allows the author to focus on content
and structure rather than form. If you have used LaTeX you are familiar with
this idea. For example, to indicate a major heading we use the
&lt;H1&gt;...&lt;/H1&gt; tag. We do not specify how the heading is rendered - that
decision is taken by the device that renders the document. So HTML (in theory)
allows us a device independent description of a document.
This is useful because the
document could be rendered through a text to speech engine just as well as
a WEB browser.
<P>
HTML is continuously evolving to meet new requirements. There are many
&quot;fancy&quot; things you can do with it. We are not going to deal with that stuff
though.
<P>
Core elements of an HTML page.
<P>
The basic format of an HTML page is:
<P>
<PRE>&lt;HTML&gt;

 &lt;HEAD&gt;
 &lt;TITLE&gt; Fire me up! &lt;/TITLE&gt; 
 &lt;/HEAD&gt;

 &lt;BODY&gt;

Your text goes here.


 &lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;</PRE>
<P>
The HTML tags are indicated inside the angle brackets. Typically they
come in pairs, with the scope being closed by the forward slash.
<P>
There are many tweaks you can do to this. An example is specifying
a background color via the BODY tag.
<PRE>&lt;BODY BGCOLOR=&quot;#ffffff&quot;&gt;</PRE>
<P>
The best way to learn these tweaks is to use the <TT>view source</TT>
option from your browser, which allows you to see the raw HTML of the
document you are viewing. Here's a link to a listing of the HTML tags
