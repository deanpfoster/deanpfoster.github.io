<P>
Perl (Practical Extraction and Report Language) 
is our language of choice for this class. Our first program will
return a WEB page.
<P>
Perl's an interpreted language - you don't have to compile it. 
It's strengths are it's ability to act as a scripting language,
it's ability to work as a glue between other programs, and it's one of
the lingua francas of the WEB. Here's our 
<A HREF="./hello_two.txt">program</A>, which we'll
discuss in class.
