<H2>1.</H2> Make a skeleton homepage written in HTML. You can use my
skeleton file as a template. (see gosset:~foster/public_html/.)  It
should be named <TT>index.html</TT> and reside in your
<TT>public_html</TT> directory. It doesn't have to contain any links
yet, but it should at least have a line describing who you are and
what you do.  You will add to this page over the course of the
semester. See <a
href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/General/Internet/WWW/HTMLPrimerP1.html#TM2">here</a>
for an introduction to HTML.

<H2> 2.</H2>
Create the <TT>hello_world</TT> form and CGI perl script. Create a 
<TT>Stat540</TT> subdirectory under the <TT>public_html</TT> directory.
Place the HTML form file in the <TT>Stat540</TT> directory. Call it
<TT>homework01.html</TT>. Place the perl script in the <TT>Stat540</TT> 
directory. Call it <TT>hello_world.pl</TT>. Make sure that the perl script
is executable by the server. This is done by typing<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"> <TT>chmod a+x hello_world.pl</TT></FONT><BR>
I should be able to run your perl script. Your grade depends on it.

<H2> 3.</H2>
Read Chapter 1 of <I>Programming Perl</I> (even if it doesn't all make sense).
