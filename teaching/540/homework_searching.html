<center><h1>  Homework on searching </h1></center>

You should write up a one page description of how your program runs.
In particular tell me what are the properties of the two heuristics
and the two search algorithms.  Talk about CPU time and how good a
solution it generates.  So you will most
(Use latex for this--don't include the code.)

<p>
The code should also run on the web.

<ol>
  <li> create a class called Heuristic that will evalualate how many
       quesses it will take to figure out which member of a set is the
       correct one in mastermind.  (In other words, it should have a
       member function that you can pass in a set of possible answer
       and it will return a number--the guess as to the number of
       moves to solve from this position.)
       <p>
  <li> Create a subclass of Heuristic, called Entropy, that inherits
from
       Heuristic.  have it return the log of the number of items in
       the set.
       <p>
  <li> Create a subclass of Heuristic, called Simulation, that uses
       your existing random quesser to estimate how many moves it will
       take to solve by guessing until it gets the solution.  It should
       have a parameter passed in when it is created to say how many
       simulations it should run.
       <p>
  <li> Write a random search algorithm that randomly generates a guess
       and then calls a Heuristic to find out how good the guess is.
       It should then make a bunch of guesses and keep track of which
       one is best.
       <p>
  <li> Write a graph search algorithm that randomly generates a
       starting guess.  Then it evaluates the heuristic for each of
       the simple modifications of that guess (i.e. changing each
       position to a different color.)  If it find a neighbor that has
       a better heuristic value, it changes to the neighbor.
       <p>
  <li> Run both search algorithms using both heuristics.  Generate
       timing statistics (CPU time) and the average number of guess to
       find a solution for a random key.
