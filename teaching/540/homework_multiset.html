<center><h1>  Homework on multisets </h1></center>

This is really a test of how well you wrote your last program and not
something completely new.  A multiset is a "set" of items for which
the key to the item is not necessarilly unique.  For example, consider
a set of people which you have sorted on age.  It is possible to have
two people in the set such that both of them have age 29.  In fact,
you might have 100s of people all of whom have age 29.  This is called
a multiset.
<p>
Obviously, this isn't very interesting if you are only saving the age
of the person.  Then if someone asks you to delete a 29 from your set,
you can delete anyone of them--they are all the same.  This isn't true
if say you also have names attached to the people.
<p>
So how should something be deleted?  The user can ask for a list of
all possible people who are of a certain age.  This returns a list of
references to people.  Now the user can say, "delete the 3rd person
on the list you gave me who is of age 29."  
<ol>
  <li> Define a person as a vector consisting of an age and a name.
<p>
  <li> Change your tree program to sort person objects by age.  You
       shouldn't look at the name field, since that would require your
       tree program to know exactly what your object looks like. 
       <p>
  <li>  You should have functions that will
       <p>
       <ol type=a>
       <li> print the tree (in a pretty fashion showing the tree
       structure)
       <li> insert nodes into the tree
       <li> find all people of a given age
       <li> delete a node from the tree
       <p>
     </ol>
  <li> Run your code on some data of your own creation.  Provide some
       discussion of what is happening as you do it.  Make sure that
       you test your code sufficiently enough to convince me that it
       runs correctly.
       <p>
       (Basically what this means, is that you will need to tell a
       story similar to the following: First we print the empty tree
       (show output).  Now we insert some unique names and ages (show
       output).  How about two people of the same age (show output).
       Can we still find both unique people and multiple people (show
       output of finding some ages).  Now lets delete a person (show
       output).  Now change the name of one of the people in the
       tree.  (Show that the tree is still the same, but the name is
       changed.)  Make sure we can still find the person.  (show
       output) etc)
       <p>
  <li> Print out your CVS log.
       <p>
</ol>

Read chapters 10, 11 and 12.  Make sure that you can create objects,
and manipulate them.  You don't have to use objects in the above
homework, but you might want to.
