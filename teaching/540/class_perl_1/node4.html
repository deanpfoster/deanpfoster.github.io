 <H2><A NAME="SECTION00011000000000000000">The <TT>for</TT> and <TT>if</TT> statements</A></H2>
<P>
The <TT>for</TT> statement allows you to perform the same block of code
for a set of values. The <TT>for</TT> loop takes three components;
one to set the initial state, a condition to test the loop variable, and
a means of modifying the looping variable.
<P>
There are two other looping commands, <TT>while</TT> and <TT>until</TT>
that evaluate a logical expression and  execute a block of code so long as 
the logical expression is true and false respectively.
<P>
The <TT>if</TT> statement evaluates a logical condition, and if that
condition turns out to be true, executes a block of code. The block is
delimited by curly brackets, as is the block for the <TT>for</TT> statement.
<P>
More than one condition can be incorporated by using the <TT>elsif</TT> 
and <TT>else</TT> constructs.
<P>
There is an <TT>unless</TT> statement, that could be expressed as an
<TT>if</TT> statement but is cleaner!
<P>
Here's as example of basic usage:
<PRE>#!/usr/local/bin/perl

for($i = 0; $i &lt; 30; $i++){
    if(( $i % 2) == 0){
        print $i, `` is an even number!\n'';
    }
}</PRE>
<P>
Flow through a loop can be modified using the <TT>next</TT> and <TT>last</TT>
operators. <TT>next</TT> allows you to skip to the end of the current loop iteration and <TT>last</TT> lets you go to the end of the block.
