<H1> Homework 2. Stat 540.</H1>

<H2> 1. </h2>

Make a cvs directory off of your home directory (the followng two
commands should work: setenv CVSROOT $home/cvs; cvs init).  Import
your public html directory into cvs.  Set your environment variables
CVSROOT to be /usr/local/home/yourname/cvs. (In tcsh this could be
done by "setenv CVSROOT $home/cvs"). Now something like

<p>

cd public_html <br>
cvs import public_html foster start

<p> should work save your public_html directory into your cvs
directory.  Move your public_html directory somewhere safe:

<p> mv public_html public_html_safe

<p> and the check out a new version of your public html directory from
cvs.

<p>

cvs co public_html

<p>

This should create a new public_html directory that works just like
the old one.  The only difference is that now you can back up by doing
a "cvs ci".  Running "cvs log index.html" should now say that you have
created the file.  Any time you edit index.html and save it in cvs,
you will add to this log file.


<P>
2. Write a Perl script to repeatedly throw 5 dice until
all 5 dice show the same number. Have the program count the number of 
iterations until this event occurs. Embed this code in a for loop
so that the simulation is repeated 1000 times. Have your program report
the empirical probability of rolling 5 dice and obtaining the
same number on all 5. 

<P>
3. Modify your subroutine that rolls the dice, so that it can be used to draw
a simple random sample with replacement of 4 colors from 6 colors (label the
colors R (red), Y (yellow), G (green), P (purple), L (lemon) and S
(silver). In essence your subroutine should accept 2 pieces of information;
the set of objects that constitute the population and the number of objects to
be drawn, and return the simple random sample.

<p>4 (easy version) Write (by hand) a web page to display the outcome of 3
sets of rolls of your dice.  It should be in a tabular format, something like 
<P>
<PRE>
&lt;TABLE&gt; &lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD&gt; R &lt;TD&gt; Y &lt;TD&gt; G &lt;TD&gt; P
&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;
</PRE>

Make your page accessible over the WEB. See if you can get it to
display different colors.  Look at your page under two or three
different browsers (say Opera, Netscape, or lynx).  Write a few
sentences describing how the different browsers display the same
information.
