### Script to show array and hash indexing.

@letters =  (alpha,beta,gamma,delta);

# Look what's inside here.

print @letters, "\n";
print "@letters\n";
print '@letters\n', "\n";

# Now start the indexing:

print "$letters[0] \n"; # The first element
print "$letters[1] \n"; # The second element
print "$letters[2] \n"; # The third element
print "$#letters \n"; # the number of elements in the array



print "@letters[0] \n"; # an array with only one element.
print "@letters[0,2] \n"; # an array with two elements.
print "@letters[1..3] \n"; # a sequential slice.


### Hashes.

%letters = ( A => alpha,
             B => beta,
             G => gamma,
             D => delta);

print %letters, "\n"; # dont' print the hash like this!

print $letters{G}, "\n"; # This will get at an element.

print keys %letters, "\n"; # This shows the keys in the hash.
print values %letters, "\n"; # This shows the values in the hash.

### Iterating over a hash. (Note the order of the output)

foreach $key (keys %letters){
    print "The value of $key is,  $letters{$key} \n";
}
