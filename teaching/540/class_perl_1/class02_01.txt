### Script to show the basic math operators on scalars.

$x = 10;
$y = 16;

print $x + $y, "\n";
print $x - $y, "\n";
print $x * $y, "\n";
print $x / $y, "\n";
print $x % $y, "\n";
print $x ** $y, "\n";


### Some built in math functions

print log($x), "\n";
print exp($x), "\n";
print sin($x), "\n";

### Some string operations.

$a = "Angola";
$z = "Zimbabwe";

print $a . $z . "\n";

print $a x 4 . "\n";


### Assignment operators, with the equals sign.


print '$x is ', "$x \n";
$x = $y;
print '$x is ', "$x \n";
print '$x is ', --$x, "\n"; 
print '$x is ', "$x \n";
print '$x is ', $x++,  "\n"; 
print '$x is ', "$x \n";
