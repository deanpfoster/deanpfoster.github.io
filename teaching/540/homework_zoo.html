<center><h1>  Homework on objects </h1></center>

For the following, give me anotated output of your program.  So tell
me in words what your program is doing and then have it do it.  It
should sound like a story at the end of the day!

<ol>
  <li> This assignment will have you create a program to manage a zoo.
       There are two basic objects, animals and cages.  Each animal
       has a  name (like Shanti the indian elephant, or Sing Sing the Panda
       bear) and a species type.  Each cage has an size and a cage
       number.
       <ol>
	 <li> In the real world, animals would have to be escorted
	      between cages with the help of zoo keepers.  we will
	      assume these animals can follow instructions--and hence
	      don't need zoo keepers.  Obviously this is just to make
	      your life easier.
	 <li> All animals should be able transport themselves from one
	      cage to another cage.
	 <li> Each cage should know which animals are members of that
	      cage.
	 <li> Implement the above description as cleanly as possible.
	 <li> Besure to have the following:
	      <ol>
		<li> Print zoo (which prints out each cage and its
		     contents)
		<li> animal -> location which returns the location of an
		     animal.
		<li> animal -> name.
		<li> animal -> species.
		<li> animal -> move_to(cage).  Has the animal move
		     to a cage.
	      </ol>
	 <li> populate your zoo with at least 4 different species of
	      animals, and 20 different animals.   Print out your zoo.
       </ol>
  <li> When animals walk they make noise.  These noises should be
       printed as the animals walk.  So a duck should go "quack quack
       quack" as it walks along.  (Obviously it takes more quacks if
       the distance between the cages is greater).  Add sounds for
       each animal to print out as it moves around.
  <li> Give each animal a home cage.  Write the following functions:
       <ol>
	 <li> start_meeting:  this should have everyone walk to the
	      "main cage" for where ever they currently are.
	 <li> end_meeting: this should have everyone walk home.
       </ol>
  <li> Finally add a "size" to each cage.  Give each animal a "size"
       also.  There shouldn't be more animals in a cage than can fit.
       Write a function called optional_move_to(cage) which checks if an
       animal can move to a cage.  If it can be moved there without
       overflowing the cage, have him move there.  This function
       should be an "animal" function not a species function.
</ol>
