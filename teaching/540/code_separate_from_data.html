<center><h1>  Statistics 540: Code separate from data</h1></center>


<h2>Announcement</h2>

<ul>
  <li> HW issues?
</ul>
<p>
<h2>lecture</h2>
code ---------------------------------------------------------------------- data
<p>
get the picture?
<ul>
  <li> In the beginning:
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> code on heavy trays
	 <li> data in lights and tubes
	 <li> life was good, but backs were sore
       </ul>
       <p>
  <li> The fall from grace--the loadable program
       <p>
       <ul>
 	 <li> makes data look just like code
	 <li> consider the following program:
       <p>
	      <ul>
		<li> loop: i = i + 1
		<li> total = total + a[i]
		<li> goto loop
	      </ul>
       <p>
	 <li> it works, but why?  It is self modifying code
       <p>
	      <ul>
		<li> i stored here
		<li> loop: i = i + 1
		<li> total = total + a[i]
		<li> goto loop
	      </ul>
       <p>
	 <li> when i overflows the i = i + 1 command polymorfs into a
	      "goto" which jumps to the value of the instruction
	      total=total+a[i].  Like wow!
       </ul>
       <p>
  <li> Fast forward: modern equivalent is a global variable
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> a = sort(b)
	 <li> increasing or decreasing?
	 <li> check a global maybe?
	 <li> yikes!
	 <li> Too ugly to even consider?  Look at most operating
	      systems code
       </ul>
       <p>
  <Li> Solutions 1: outlaw it
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> functional programming
	 <li> some mroe pure than others
	 <li> remimber: lisp was the orginal functional programming
	      language and was loved since you could write programs
	      that wrote programs!
	 <li> so it takes some careful control
       </ul>
       <p>
  <li> solution 2: ignore it
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> leads to microsoft(r) viruses
	 <li> a word(r) file shouldn't be able to be a program!
       </ul>
       <p>
  <li> solution 3: control it
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> object orented programming
	 <li> read chapters 10 and 11
       </ul>
</ul>
