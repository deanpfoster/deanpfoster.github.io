<P>
Most random number generators (RNG) aren't. They are completely deterministic.
<P>
They produce a stream of numbers, each new number being calculated
deterministically from it's predecessor. We hope that this deterministic
stream provides similar characteristics to a truly random stream.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SECTION00010100000000000000">Linear congruential</A></H3>
<P>

Call the new number <IMG WIDTH=17 HEIGHT=23 ALIGN=MIDDLE
ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline63" SRC="./img1.gif" > , then it is produced
from <IMG WIDTH=33 HEIGHT=21 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline65"
SRC="img2.gif" > using the relationship:
<P> <IMG WIDTH=340 HEIGHT=16 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="displaymath67" SRC="img3.gif"  > <P>
For example, if <I>a</I> = 1, <I>b</I> = 3 and <I>c</I> = 7 with  <IMG WIDTH=49 HEIGHT=23 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline73" SRC="img4.gif"  >  we get the 
stream: {3,6,2,5,1,4,0,3,6,2,  ...}.
Notice that it starts repeating (the period) after 7 values. The maximal period for one of these generators will be <I>c</I> - I lucked out, there is no reason why the period has to equal <I>c</I>.
<P>
Here's  what you get if you do a <TT>man drand48</TT> on our system:
<PRE>DESCRIPTION
     This family of  functions  generates  pseudo-random  numbers
     using  the  well-known linear congruential algorithm and 48-
     bit integer arithmetic.</PRE>
By default drand48 uses c = 2**48, a = 5DEECE66D base 16, and
b = B base 16.
<P>
There is a well known and classic LC-RNG that's implemented in ANSI C.
It uses <I>a</I> = 1103515245, <I>b</I> = 12345 and <I>c</I> = 32768. There's obviously
something not too good about this! But really, when asking the question 
of whether or not a RNG is any good, you need to know the context in
which the thing will be used. For the Mastermind game, this would be fine.
Used as a method for making pseudo random keys for encryption
algorithms would be another matter.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SECTION00010200000000000000">Multiplicative congruential</A></H3>
<P>
These are a specialization of the LC-RNG in which <I>b</I> is set equal to zero, so we have
<P> <IMG WIDTH=327 HEIGHT=16 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="displaymath85" SRC="img5.gif"  > <P>
These are faster and can do just as well as the linear generator. Check out the
man page for <TT>rand</TT>
<P>
<PRE> rand() uses a multiplicative congruential random-number gen-
     erator  with  period  2^32  that  returns successive pseudo-
     random numbers in the range from 0 to (2^15)-1.</PRE>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SECTION00010300000000000000">Linear feedback shift registers</A></H3>
<P>
These deterministic methods generate a stream of pseudo random bits, (0/1).
Bits can be combined to produce integers of course.
<P>
Start with a seed , say 7, write it in base 2, <TT>{1,1,1,1}</TT>.<BR> 
Shift everything to the right by 1 bit <TT>{?, 1,1,1}</TT>.<BR> 
Define a rule for filling in the question mark - say XOR (exclusive or), 
the second and third bits, to get <TT>{0,1,1,1}</TT>.<BR> 
Repeat.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SECTION00010400000000000000">Really, really random</A></H3>
<P>
One method of getting at really random integers is to use the time between
key strokes on the keyboard. Another is to use  a chaotic source within the
computer itself, airflow, heat etc can serve as bases for these.
<P>
Perl has a <B>module</B> called <TT>Math-TrulyRandom</TT> to implement the
key stroke timing approach - it would be useful for encryption programs
for example.
