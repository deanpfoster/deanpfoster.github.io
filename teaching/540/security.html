<center><h1>  Statistics 540: Security issues </h1></center>


<h2>Homework:</h2>
       <p> Your first homework is to get logged onto gosset using a
public/private key by 5:00 monday.  Details are found in <a
href="./homework_ssh.html">Homework 0</a>.

<H2>Admistrivia</h2>

<ul>
  <li> HTML can be learned on the web
  <li> Perl can be learned on the web in conjuction with Wall's book
       (I'll treate Wall's book as the text for the class).
</ul>

<h2>Security</h2>

<h3>Security model</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Alice --> Bob.  Eve is trying to listen in.
  <li> Alice uses a cypher: e(b.pub,x) -> y.  d(b,y) -> x.
       <ul>
	 <li> A one way function is: if you know e,d.pub,k1, can not determine k2
	 <li> Example: squareroots modulo the product of two large primes (called RSA)
	 <li> Called public key/private key encryption
	 <li> Everyone in the world knows e,d,b.pub, only Bob knows b
	 <li> In RSA everyone knows pq.  But only Bob knows the factors p and q.
       </ul>
  <li> see
       <center>
       <cite>
       B. Schneier, "Applied Cryptography, Second Edition", Wiley, 1996.
       </cite>
       </center>
       for a deeper understanding of todays lecture
</ul>
<h3>Theory of applications</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
       Sending email to a friend.  (x = message to send).  send
       y = e(b.pub,x) to friend.  They open it using d(b,y) to recover
       x.  Unfortunately they have no idea who sent it to them.
  <li>
       sending a private an email so your friend can prove you wrote
       it.  So
       send: e(b.pub,d(a,x)).  They decrypt with d(a.pub,e(b(x)).  No
       one else could send it.  No one else can read it.
  <li> Signing a public announcement so everyone knows you wrote it.
       Publish x and y = e(a,x).  Everyone can compute d(a.pub,y) and
       confirm it equals x.  No one else could have generated y.
  <li>
       Verifing who you are on a protected chanel.  Method: Alice send
       Bob a challenge of x.
       Bob computes y=d(b,x) and returns it to Alice.  Alice confirms
       that e(b.pub,y) = x.
  <li> Virifying who you are on a public chanel.  Combine method 2 and
       4 above!
  <li> Thought exercise: Use above to generate a concept of electronic
       cash.  It should be secure and anonymous.
 </ol>

 <h3>Attacks</h3>
 <ol>
   <li>
	listening in
   <li>
	man in the middle attacks (reason for fingerprints in pgp/gpg)
   <li>
	trafic analysis (reason for email bounce points)
   <li>
	physical security (not really an issues)
 </ul>

 <h3>SSH</h3>
 <ul>
   <li>
	ssh authenticates users via cryptography
   <li>
	It is "easy" to use
   <li> setup
	<ul>
	  <li> 
	       machines keep track of public key/private key pairs for each
	       machine
	  <li>
	       users put public key on machine they want to login to
	  <li>
	</ul>
   <li> logging in
	<ul>
	  <li>
	       machines get connection with each other using previous keys to
	       authenticate who the machine is.  (this avoids
	       man-in-the-middle)  Question: which machines must have the
	       public key?
	  <li> system sends a chalange to user
	  <li> user incrypts chalenge and returns it
	  <li> system verify's chalenge and opens a channel for
	       communication
	  <li> user is logged in!
	</ul>
   <li> What one gets out of this.
	<ul>
	  <li> Secure file movement (scp, sftp)
	  <li> secure x windows graphics
	  <li> can open up secure side channels (fancy stuff)
	  <li> ease of use.  (simple passwords are good enough)
	</ul>
 </ul>
 <h3>Does it work?</h3>
 <ul>
   <li>
	Users can undermine security.
   <li>
	Suppose user uses name of cat for pasword (blacky) to ssh.  We
	are safe IF the machine they are comeing in from is totally
	secure.  (based on public key/private key security.)  
   <li>
	Suppose user has unsafe machine (one that allows password long
	ons) and uses "blacky" for password to unsafe machine AND
	secure machine.  Now it is easy to break in.
   <li>
	But ssh doesn't leak passwords.  So is ANY ssh machine safe
	with "blacky"?  No, password attacks.
   <li>
	Moral: Keep 3 passwords of different levels of security.  One
	should be "blacky" which you give to they NYTs.  (For example,
	my public password is "india".)  One should be private but
	insecure.  Use it to log in to web sites that deal with
	money (something like perl45fuN)  Finally one should be
	involitile and NEVER passed over an insecure channel.
 </ul>
