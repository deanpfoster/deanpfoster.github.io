<H1>  Homework 0: Setting up SSH</H1>
<p>

By 5:00 Monday, be sure you can ssh into gosset.wharton.upenn.edu.

<ul>
  <li> SSH: I have a general introduction to setting up ssh under linux <a
       href="/system_notes/ssh.html">here</a>.  If you are using a Windows
       box, Janice Lee (the stat deparment computer person) says it is
       easy: "Setting up the SSH key was also not
       difficult.  It's actually very easily done from inside SecureCRT with
       plenty of handholding available from the help files.  I guess if you
       wanted to do it the hard way, you could use PuTTY instead of
       SecureCRT.  But I think SecureCRT is fine and not difficult to set up,
       so this should no longer be a difficult process."
  <li> Our computer will be gosset.wharton.upenn.edu
  <li> After you have your public key/private key pair generated,
       email me the public key and I'll make you an account.
