<center><h1>  Homework on sorting </h1></center>

This homework should be done in hard copy.  
<p>

Each subroutine should be divided into as many subroutines as is possibly
natural.  If I can naturally divide up one of your algorithms, it will
be considered incorrect!
<p>
Each subroutine should check that its inputs are basically correct.
<p>

Each subroutine should have a comment describing how to use it.  What
it returns.  And what has to be passed in.


<ol>
  <li> Write a quick sort in perl.
       <p>
  <li> Write a selection sort in perl.
       <p>
  <li> Make a plot of the CPU time vs size of input for each algorithm. 
       <p>

  <li> Surf the web and find a merge sort in perl.  Print it out.  See
if you can understand what it is doing.  How many subroutines could
you break it into?
