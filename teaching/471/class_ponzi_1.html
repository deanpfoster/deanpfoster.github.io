<center><h1>  Statistics 701: Ponzironi</h1></center>


<h2>Announcement</h2>

<ul>
  <li> HW2 due soon
<li> Notes: <a
href="being_warren_buffett.ps">.ps</a>,  <a
href="being_warren_buffett.pdf">.pdf</a>. I'll probably be updating
these notes over the next few days.  But the first 10 pages won't
change very much.
</ul>

<H2>Ponzironi</h2>
<ul>
  <li> What is a Ponzi scheme?
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Sometimes called pyramid schemes, multi-level marketing schemes, airplane schemes, sometimes called simply mail-fraud
	 <li> Start with 100 investors.  All give 100 dollars.
	 <li> Each month find 10 new investors to each give 100 dollars.
	 <li> Pay this new money to the existing investors
	 <li> Keep finding new investors each month.
	 <li> Once you can't find anyone else new the scheme is said to crash
       </ul>
       <p>
  <li> Our goal: fake a Ponzi scheme (legally?)
       <p>
  <li> First story: Mathnet
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> send out 64 emails: 32 forcasting market up 32 forcasting market down
	 <li> send out 32 emails to those who we got right in first rund: 16 up 16 down
	 <li> send out 16 emails: 8 up 8 down
	 <li> send out 8 emails: 4 up 3 down
	 <li> send out 4 emails: 2 up 2 down
	 <li> send out 2 emails: 1 up 1 down
	 <li> Now send out email asking for money for next forecast
       </ul>
       <p>
  <li> Second story: starting many Hedge funds
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Start 64 hedge funds: 32 leverage market up, 32 leverage market fall
	 <li> Fold losing 32
	 <li> Of 32 winners: 16 leverage market up, 16 leverage market fall
	 <li> Fold losing 16
	 <li> ...
	 <li> Last 6 month track record: doubling every month
	 <li> Show track record to very rich person--ask for one million dollar investment
       </ul>
       <p>
  <li> Third story: Search through database
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Start with 64 rules for picking a stock (think leveraged)
	 <li> Each month or two kill off the bottom 1/2 of the rules
	 <li> After a year or so, you have one rule that has grown spictularilly
       </ul>
       <p>
  <li> How big might the t-statistic be following such a scheme?
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Suppose you do n different tests
	 <li> Bonferonni p-value = n * regular p-value
	 <li> If JMP won't do it for you, use sqrt(2 log(n)) for significance
	 <li> If you require Bonferonni significance, you will rarely
	      fall into the trap of 3rd story.
       </ul>
       <p>
</ul>
