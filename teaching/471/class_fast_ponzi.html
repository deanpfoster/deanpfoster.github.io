<h2>Announcement</h2>

<ul>
  <li> 
</ul>

<H2>Mathnet</h2>
<ul>
  <li> First story: Mathnet
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> send out 64 emails: 32 forcasting market up 32 forcasting market down
	 <li> send out 32 emails to those who we got right in first rund: 16 up 16 down
	 <li> send out 16 emails: 8 up 8 down
	 <li> send out 8 emails: 4 up 3 down
	 <li> send out 4 emails: 2 up 2 down
	 <li> send out 2 emails: 1 up 1 down
	 <li> Now send out email asking for money for next forecast
       </ul>
       <p>
  <li> Second story: starting many Hedge funds
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Start 64 hedge funds: 32 leverage market up, 32 leverage market fall
	 <li> Fold losing 32
	 <li> Of 32 winners: 16 leverage market up, 16 leverage market fall
	 <li> Fold losing 16
	 <li> ...
	 <li> Last 6 month track record: doubling every month
	 <li> Show track record to very rich person--ask for one million dollar investment
       </ul>
       <p>
  <li> Third story: Search through database
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Start with 64 rules for picking a stock (think leveraged)
	 <li> Each month or two kill off the bottom 1/2 of the rules
	 <li> After a year or so, you have one rule that has grown spictularilly
       </ul>
       <p>


       <p>
  <li> How big might the t-statistic be following such a scheme?
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Suppose you do n different tests
	 <li> Bonferonni p-value = n * regular p-value
	 <li> If JMP won't do it for you, use sqrt(2 log(n)) for significance
	 <li> If you require Bonferonni significance, you will rarely
	      fall into the trap of 3rd story.
       </ul>
       <p>
   <li> Dawkins chapter discuss how big n might be in various settings.
   <li> Comes up frequently in modern statistics: I've searched
through 67,000 variables looking for signal.  Clearly I don't want to
be impressed by a p-value of .05.

</ul>

<H2>Ponzironi schemes</h2>


<ul>
  <li> What is a Ponzi scheme?
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Sometimes called pyramid schemes, multi-level marketing schemes, airplane schemes, sometimes called simply mail-fraud
	 <li> Start with 100 investors.  All give 100 dollars.
	 <li> Each month find 10 new investors to each give 100 dollars.
	 <li> Pay this new money to the existing investors
	 <li> Keep finding new investors each month.
	 <li> Once you can't find anyone else new the scheme is said to crash
       </ul>
       <p>
  <li> Our goal: fake a Ponzi scheme (legally?)

</ul>

<H2>Faking a good empirical track record</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Would a scheme that returned 2% over the market for the last 2
       years impress you?
       <ul>
	 <li> last 10 years?
	 <li> last 20 years?
	 <li> last 100 years?
       </ul>
       <p>
  <li> Our goal is to generate such impressive returns without having
       to understand actual stocks and bonds.
       <p>
  <li> A Ponzi scheme for quiet customers
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Start with 1000 customers who each give 1000 dollars
	 <li> Each month, tell 10% of them that their account has gone
	      bust and no longer has any money in it.
	 <li> Distribute the money of those busted 10% to the remaining
	      players. 
	 <li> After several rounds, you have a "client list" of
	      customers each whom has seen 10% returns over the past
	      several rounds.
	 <li> After 25 periods you are down to 10 people.  The scheme
	      basically crashes at this point.  Notice that these
	      people have seen a 10% return for 25 rounds.  They each now
	      hold 100,000 dollars!
       </ul>
       <p>
  <li> Problem: The busted part of your client list will complain and
       the scheme will be busted by the police.
       <p>
  <li> Principle: Dead people don't talk.
       <p>
  <li> Bettter principle: Non-existant people talk even less!
       <p>
  <li> A Ponzironi scheme (pick one random player from your orginal
       list and track their wealth.)
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Start with 1 customer who gives 1000 dollars
	 <li> Each month, place a bet which has a 91% chance of paying
	      out 10% of the current value and a 9.1% chance of losing
	      the whole thing.
	 <li> If lucky, give money to client
	 <li> If unlucky, tell client that they are busted
	 <li> You have a 1/100 chance of making as far as 25 rounds
	      before your one client crashes.
	 <li> After 25 periods you are down to 10 people.  The scheme
	      basically crashes at this point.
       </ul>
       <p>
</ul>
<H2>Estimating the probability of rare events.</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Suppose you are watching a biathelon (skiing and shooting) and
       the shooter has hit 25/25 so far.  What is her chance of
       missing?
       <p>
  <li> Suppose the true probability of missing is p, then to get 25/25
       would have a chance of (1-p)^25.  This is a very small
       probability IF p > 3/25.  But, if p < 3/25, the chance of this
       occuring is greater than 5%.
       <p>
  <li> Rule for seeing no misses in n shots so far:
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> 0 < chance of missing < 3/n  is 95% confidence interval
	 <li> 0 < chance of missing < 5/n  is 99.5% confidence interval
	 <li> 0 < chance of missing < 10/n  is 99.995% confidence interval
	 <li> 0 < chance of missing < k/n  is 1 - exp(-k) confidence interval
       </ul>
       <p>
  <li> Example:
       Suppose you are watching 1000 biathelons in order to possibly
       pick one to join your team.  The best shooter never misses.   How should
       you estimate her chance of missing?  Use 1 - .05/1000 for confidence
       level.  That means that k = 10. 
</ul>
<H2>How good a record can we fake?</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Above scheme requires the possibility of losing everything.
  <li> What if the amount we can lose is bounded?
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Any instrument for which options exist, can be converted
	      to having bounded downside.  (Of course this lowers the
	      return.) 
	 <li> Options can be "replicated" as long as the instrument is
	      publically traded.
	 <li> So publically traded assest can have their downside
	      protected.
	 <li> (Simple rule: sell if price drops more than 10% during
	      any month.  Your sell might not get executed until it
	      has dropped a bit further.  This will depend on market
	      thickness.  Then hold cash for the rest of the month.)
	 <li> Hedge funds can't have options written against them
	      since buying and selling only occurs monthly instead of
	      continuously. 
       </ul>
       <p>
  <li> With bounded loss, we are forced to use a smaller disaster.
       Hence we can't fake as good performace.  
</ul> 

<H2>Why read a mutual fund prospectus?</h2>
<ul>
  <li> An alternative to using options to bound the loss is to read
       the prospectus.
       <p>
  <li> A mutual fund who can use leverage can generate larger swings.
       <p>
  <li> If only stocks can be purchased, downsides can be much lower
       <p>
  <li> If only big stock can be purchase and they must be diversified,
       then the downside is lower still.
</ul>

<h2>Buy side: the three disasters rule</h2>
<ul>
  <li>  Determine what a total disaster would be by one of the
       following methods:  (listed best to worst)
       <p>
       <ol>
	 <li> Use actual options then the downside is legally
	      determined
	 <li> Use active trading.  Assume you monitor the value of the
	      fund and anytime it drops by X% you sell.  You don't buy
	      again until next period.  Charge yourself Y% for
	      transaction costs AND how much it might have dropped
	      past X%.  Ideally this requires using tic-by-tic data.
	 <li> Estimate a disaster drop by reading the prospectus.  How
	      bad might things go?
	 <li> Use -100% as the definition of a disaster
       </ol>
       <p>
  <li> Make a column of empirical returns
       <p>
  <li> Add three disasters to this column
       <p>
  <li> Test if the average return for this column is higher than
       expected.  
</ul>
