<center><h1>  Statistics 701: CAPM from a statistical perspective</h1></center>


<h2>Announcement</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Homework 3 questions?
       <ul>
	 <li> brushing
	 <li> stepwise regression.  how to. number of varaibles.  breaking JMP IN.
	 <li> which data.
       </ul>

</ul>

<H2>Summary so far</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Ponzironi 1: Bonferonni p-value = n * regular p-value.
  <li> Ponzironi 2: Unseen crashes can be delt with by adding 3 of them to your data.
  <li> Ponzironi 3: Correct for risk since variance matters.
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> long run growth rate = mean - variance / 2
	 <li> optimal amount of one investment: alpha/MSE
	 <li> Figure of merit: alpha<sup>2</sup>/MSE = alpha<sup>2</sup>/RMSE<sup>2</sup>
       </ul>
</uL>

<H2>Optimal investing</h2>
<ul>
  <li> What if you have more than one instrument?
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Good life: means add AND variances add
	 <li> Life is 1/2 good.  means always add
	 <li> Variances only add if uncorrelated
       </ul>
       <p>
  <li> How do you make something uncorrelated with the market?
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> Look at residInvestment = (Y-RF) - beta(M-RF)
	 <li> sell beta of (M-R) buy (Y-RF)
	 <li> Claim resid is uncorrelated with market if beta is choosen correct (otherwise residuals wouldn't be flat)
	 <li> So use beta = beta of regression of Y on market
	 <li> mean is now alpha of regression (just like CAPM)
	 <li> SD = SD from regression
       </ul>
       <p>
  <li> How much to buy of each? (if uncorrelated)
       <p>
       <ul>
	 <li> optimize each separately
	 <li> buy correct amount of market
	 <li> buy a alpha/SD<sup>2</sup>
	 <li> Key thing: is alpha significantly bigger than zero?  
       </ul>
       <p>
  <li> If you are more risk adverse, buy more of the risk free and less of risky assets
</ul>
  
<h2>CAPM</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Notice, if alpha > 0, everone wants to buy
  <li> Notice, if alpha < 0, everone wants to sell
  <li> Hence price is not in equilibrium unless alpha = 0
</ul>
<h2>Putting it all together</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Figure of merit: R = alpha<sup>2</sup>/MSE
  <li> Growth of log optimal portfolio increases by R/2
  <li> It takes 4/R years to statistically prove this investment is
       profitable using out-of-sample data
       <ul>
	 <li> Find an R of 1, and CAPM is dead in 4 years
	 <li> Find an R of .01 and CAPM is indistinqushable from
	      "better model" for next 400 years
	 <li> For reference: T-bills vs. cash has R =
	      (.03/.01)<sup>2</sup> = 9 (takes several months to prove better)
	 <li> For reference: Market vs. t-bills has R =
	      (.07/.2)<sup>2</sup> = .12 (takes 30 years to prove)
       </ul>
</ul>
<h2>Example: The Quant-Jock</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Suppose you put a quant jock in a cage and ask him questions:
       Is XYZ corp a good investment?  Five minutes later he gives an
       answer. 
  <li> A game the traders play is guess what the quant jock will say.
       No one can guess what he will say better than 50/50.
  <li> To the world, the quant jock looks like a coin toss
  <li> BUT, over the course of a year the quant jock's "buys" grow by
       2 percent a year compared to his "sells". 
  <li> What is his figure of merit?
  <li> Portfolio: Buy his "buys," short his "sells".  Buy portfolio is
       correlated at least .99 with sell portfolio (same variance).  Thus
       difference as has a variance of (1 - R<sup>2</sup>) * variance
       of market = .02 * (.2)<sup>2</sup>.
  <li> Figure of merit: (.02)<sup>2</sup>/(.02 * .2<sup>2</sup>) = .5
  <li> Doubles every two years
  <li> Takes 8 years to "prove" method is successful
</ul>
