\item The driving model in evolution is the $r,K$-model.\footnote{see
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-selection}{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-selection}.}
for an overview.)  Basically the story is that populations grow
exponentially (at rate $r$) until they end up reaching their carrying
capacity ($K$).  So, the population growing curve looks like a
logistic function%
\footnote{see \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function}{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic\_function}.}

We will fit some data to this model.  Traditionally, one counts the
 number of lizards on a new island every year over a decade or two.
  This is interesting biology and important science, but isn't really
 very interesting when it comes to data analysis.  So we will use a
 more interesting (but less accurately modeled) data set--namely
 AIDS/HIV cases in the USA.

One data series for the number of new cases of AIDS from the AVERT
website%
\footnote{see
\href{http://www.avert.org/usa-statistics.htm}{http://www.avert.org/usa-statistics.htm}.
I couldn't find useful data on the
\href{http://www.cdc.gov/Hiv/topics/surveillance/resources/factsheets/incidence.htm}{cdc}
which is where I would expect the best data to be.}
is the following:

\item We want to fit the function $Y = K/(1+e^{-rt})$ to this series.
Unfortunately, this is not an intrinsicly linear model.%
\footnote{We discussed these in class.  If you forgot what they are, I
found a small discussion here \href{http://pj.freefaculty.org/stat/NonlinearRegression/NonlinearRegression1-1.0.pdf}{http://pj.freefaculty.org/stat/NonlinearRegression/NonlinearRegression1-1.0.pdf}.}
So it is hard to fit this using a regression.  If you are using R, you
can fit this anyway as an optimization problem.  But in JMP, there is
no simple way to do it.  So fit it by ``eye.''  In other words, come
up with a $K$ that you feel matches the maximum growth point, and a
exponential growth parameter that matches the growth rate.  Now plot
this function.  When you have a curve that looks about right, you will
need to identify what year is ``t=0'' to match your data as well as
possible.   So your deliverable here are 4 things:
\begin{itemize}
\item $K$
\item $r$
\item Year for $t=0$.
\item Plot of your fit overlaying the plot of the data.
\end{itemize}
So for example, if you claim time starting in 1955 is a good place,
and the maximum value is 100,000 and it grows by 50\% every year, then you
are fitting the model $Y = 100000/(1+e^{-.5(t-1955)}$ to your data.
\item The actual growth model claims that $dY/dt = rY(1 - Y/K)$.  We
can actually fit this model instead.  To do it, create a difference of
our $Y$'s.  This will be our ``$dY/dt$'' piece of our model.  Now use
as variables $Y$ and $Y^2$.  We can now fit $diff(Y) = \alpha + \beta
Y + \gamma Y^2$.  We have now made our model intrinsically linear.  In
other words, we can fit it by a regression now.  
\begin{enumerate}
\item Fit this model.  Work out what $r$ and $K$ are from your fit to
the model.  The true model doesn't have an $\alpha$ in it.  So does the
$\alpha$ appear to be zero?
\item You can actually force JMP (and also R) to leave off the
constant term.  Tick the box saying ``no constant'' in the regression
and rerun the model.  Does this change your estimates of $r$ and $K$?
Can you explain why this happens?
\item Plot the resulting growth curve that this model corresponds to.
Do you like it better or worse than the curve you came up with by
fitting it by eye?
\item (discussion question, say 2 paragraphs total) Are the $r$ and
 $K$ that you came up with above reasonable?  Does this model make
 biological sense?  Do they match The fit generated by the some other
 researchers?
