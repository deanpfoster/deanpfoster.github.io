<p> Deliverable: For your group, I want a one paragraph write up of
your decision making, and the 4 final values for your wealth.  You
don't have to answer each discussion question in text--just discuss it
with your partner.

<center><h1>In class finance simulation</h1></center>



<P> You will use three dice to simulate the uncertainty in financial
markets.  There are three basic instruments in this simplified market,
each associated with a single die.  </P>

<tr> <th>Color Die <th> Annual Return <th>Variability (SD) </tr>
<tr> <td>green     <td> 7.5%          <td>20%              </tr>
<tr> <td>Red       <td> 71%           <td>130%             </tr>

<LI>Before starting the simulation, which of the three investments
looks most appealing to you?  Does the group agree (have a consensus)
or is it not so clear?</LI>
</p>
     
<LI> The rest of this assignment deals with a small simulation of these
     three financial instruments represented by the dice described
     above.  For each &quot;year&quot; of the game, you will roll all
     three dice, and use the outcomes to determine what has happened
     to the value of each investment.  Each of the three investments
     starts off with an initial value of $1000.  Run the game out for
     25 years.  Did you pick the winner?  Do you want to change your
  opinion of which is best? 
     </LI>

<P>The following table shows how the rolls of the dice affect the
     values of the three investments.</P>

<P>For example, suppose that on the first roll of all three dice, you obtain
</p>
<center> (Green 2)           (Red 5)             (White 3)
</center>
</p>
<p>
Then the values of the investments after the first year become
</p>
<center>
<table border=0>
<tr><td align=right> Green: <td align=right> $1000 * 0.9 <td>= $900</tr>
<tr><td align=right> Red: <td align=right>  $1000 * 3 <td>= $3000</tr>
<tr><td align=right> White: <td align=right>  $1000 * 1<td> = $1000</tr>
</table>
</center>
</p>
<P>
For the next roll, the values are compounded from these. Suppose that
on the second roll of all three dice,&#9; you obtain<BR>

<center>(Green 4)  (Red 2) (White 6)<BR></center>
<p>
then the values of the three investments after two years are<BR>
</p>
</p>
<center>
<table border=0>
<tr><td align=right> Green: <td align=right> $900 * 1.1 <td>= $990</tr>
<tr><td align=right> Red: <td align=right>  $3000 * .2 <td>= $600</tr>
<tr><td align=right> White: <td align=right>  $1000 * 1.1<td> = $1100</tr>
</table>
</center>
</p>
   
<LI> Now considers the performance of a hybrid investment, one which
mixes the outcomes of "Red"; and "White".  To compute the value of
this investment, roll both the red and white dice for each round.
It&#146;s easiest to describe what to do with an example.  
For the first round, using the same dice rolls as above (Green 2),
(Red 5) and (White 3), the value of this "Pink" investment is <BR>
</p>
<center>
Pink: $1000 * (3 + 1)/2 <td>= $2000
</center>
</p>
and compounded in the second round which had (Green 4), (Red 2), and (White 6)<BR>
<p>
<center>
Pink: $2000 * (0.2 + 1.1)/2 <td>= $1300
</center>
Before
doing any simulating, what do you think of this hybrid?  </p>

 Simulate the hybrid.  (Or if you have the rolls you made the
first time around, use those rolls.)  What happens?  How does it compare to
the previous instruments?  Which of the 4 investments do you like the best now?
