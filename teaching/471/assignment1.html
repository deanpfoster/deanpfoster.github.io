question number 1, page 43. 
<p>
  <ul>
   <li> (<a href="berndt">data</a>)
<p>
   <li> For part (d) of
this question estimate the parameters directly from the
regression equation - you don't have to use Eq.(2.18).
<p>
  <li> Waterman addendum.

<P> What did you learn?  (Carefully critique the regression you have
just performed from the validity/residual/influence perspective. Use
all the exploratory tools you know; residuals, leverage, quantile
plots etc to investigate the appropriateness of the simple linear
regression. If possible provide an explanation for any anomalies or
outliers in the data.)

 <P>
 Write up your commentary and critique of the regression analysis in
not more than two pages of text together with 3-5 pages of graphics.
