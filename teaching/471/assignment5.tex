\begin{enumerate}
\item Suppose you have three friends, creatively called $A$, $B$ and
$C$.  Prove that if you give each of them 1/3 of a dollar and let it
ride, that your average return will be approximately as high as the
best of these three.

\item One argument as to why the proof I gave in class works is that
the log is a too crude summary of wealth.  So if we had to work with
real money, the proof would not work.  Let's show that theory wrong.

In this story, we will assume you have two friends who will help you
pick ponies at a race track.  Now since gambling is illegal, we will
have your maximum amount you can win be a single penny.  To avoid all
issues of wealth, we won't worry about stakes and odds and all that.
So your problem is:

\begin{itemize}
\item Before each race is run, decide who you want to bet for you,
 friend A or friend B.  Call this $w_t$.  (Of course you can be
 wishywashy and got with a fraction of each as long as it adds up to
 exactly one.)
\item When the race $t$ is run, friend A will win $a_t$ pennies, and
friend $B$ will win $b_t$ pennies.
\item You collect $c_t = w_t a_t + (1-w_t) b_t$.
\end{itemize}

Your goal is to have your average winnings be about the same as the
better of the two average winnings of your two friends.  In other words:
\begin{displaymath}
\frac{\sum_{t=1}^T c_t}{T} \approx \max(\frac{\sum_{t=1}^T b_t}{T},\frac{\sum_{t=1}^T b_t}{T})
\end{displaymath}
So, no tricks this time.  No compounding.  No logs.  Just the real
average.  Ok, let's figure out how to do this.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If you bet with your friend who has currently won the most, show
that there is a sequence for which you aren't close to winning as much
as your better friend wins.
\item If you always hedge your bets and put 1/2 with each, show that
there is a sequence for which you aren't close to winning as much
as your better friend wins.
\end{enumerate}

\item For each of the following loss function, say what probability
you would announce if you believe the true probability was 50/50.
\begin{enumerate}
\item loss$(p,X) = I_{p>.9}X$
\item ...
\end{enumerate}

\item Consider the following three forecasting rules,
\begin{eqnarray*}
\overline{X}_t & = & \sum_{i=1}^{t-1} \frac{X_i}{t-1}\\
{\cal s}_t & = & 2/3 - X_{t-1}/3 \\
{\cal E}_t & = & .9 {\cal E}_{t-1} + .1 X_{t-1}
\end{eqnarray*}
The first one is just the average of all the previous days.  The
 second {\em switches} back and forth based on what the previous day
 looked like.  And the third is called an {\em exponential smooth} of
the previous 10 days.  Notice, none of them have a clue as to what to
forecast on the first day.  So just set them to something like .5
until they are up and running.
\begin{enumerate}
\item First make a simple simulation of weather, say IID 50/50, call
it {\bf RAIN}.  Use say, 1000 observations.
\item Now make a column in JMP (or an R function) which will represent
each of these forecasts.
\item Compute the calibration curve for each of these three
forecasts.  (You can do this by simply plotting {\bf RAIN} vs each of
the three forecasts and then doing your favorite smooth.)  This is
called the calibration curve.  We can call it $C(f)$.
\item You can pretty much see what is going on by looking at the
picture.  But to get a number that you can apply to these forecasts,
proceed as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item save the smooth generate in the previous section.
\item compute the difference between the smooth and the forecast.
\item Now square this difference and compute the average.
\end{enumerate}
You have now computed;
\begin{displaymath}
\hbox{calibration score} = \sum_{t=1}^T (C(\overline{X}_t) - \overline{X}_t)^2/T
\end{displaymath}
If this number is small, it says the forecast $\overline{X}_t$ is
close to calibrated for this data.  If it is large, it isn't close to
calibrated. 
\item Now the fun begins.  Generate some new data for {\bf RAIN}.
Think evil!  Try to make the calibration plots as bad as possible for
each of the three forecasts.  Some ideas to try:
\begin{itemize}
\item IID with different probabilities
\item $0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,\ldots$
\item $0,0,0,0,0,0,0,\ldots,1,1,1,1,1,\ldots$ (say 500 of each)
\item For those in my 433 class, maybe a Markov chain might be
nice. Something like:
\begin{displaymath}
\left[\begin{array}{cc}.9 &.1\\.2 & .8
\end{array}
\right]
\end{displaymath}
\item Have the probability of rain change over time.  For example,
have the probability of rain be equal to the forecast made by ONE of
the three forecasting rules and see if that messes up another
forecasting rule.
\item Any other ideas?
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}


\end{enumerate}
