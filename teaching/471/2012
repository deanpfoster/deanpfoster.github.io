Here are suggestions from the 2011 class (notes taken by Sathya):

- More R sessions in the beginning.
- An R homework on the basics, like creating a dataframe, etc.
- have casacaded questions or smaller homeworks than large ones. But
clumping and spacing out allows students get help. 
- Linear algebra basics should be taught before PCA. More PCA classes
in general. Two people haven't seen matrices at all. Others know
matrix multiplication. 
- Maybe a help session on linear algebra?
- intuitive approach is good but more math is nice. On the other hand,
this course was heavily mathematical! What??? 
- use more methods and maybe use different datasets.
- class on financial basics. Or more bio. Linguistics is cool. Maybe
less finance. 
- more theory in appendices of notes.
- more datasets for each topic!

- most relaxed stats class ever. Lack of grading structure is good!
  Maybe put this in the course description on Penn intouch. Also
  mention that this is a topics class and not the traditional
  structured one.

- more time for project. Give the project about half the semester.
