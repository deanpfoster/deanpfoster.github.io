<h2>Announcement</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Homework 3 questions?
</ul>

</ul>

<H2>Summary so far</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Ponzironi 1: If you try enough times, you will win by chance alone.  Use the
       bonferonni p-value to correct for this.  (Multiply p-value *
       number of searches).
  <li> Ponzironi 2: Worry about the unseen rare event.  Estimate the
       number of unseen rare events by assume 3 of them occured.
  <li> Today we study a third way towards excess returns: don't
       correct for risk.
</uL>

<H2>Dice example</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Pick a partner and do the dice simulation: <a href="financial_dice.html">simulation</a>. 
</ul>
<h2>Debreifing</h2>
<ul>
<li> Show of hands: Who liked: Green? Red? White?
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li> White is like T-Bills/cash.
    <li> Green is like the market
    <li> Red is like an "internet stock."  
    </ul>
    </p>
<li> What was your final wealth for white/green/red?
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li> Make a histogram of each (0 - 2000 for white, 0 - 20,000 green)
    <li> Red mostly goes to zero, but someone will prob. be lucky (billions of dollars final wealth)<br>
    </ul>
    </p>
<li> Growth is determined not just by the mean but also by the variance
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li> Joe's boss gets mad at him, and cuts his pay 10%
    <li> The next day, his boss says he isn't mad anymore and so gives him a 10% raise.
    <li> Why isn't Joe completely happy about this?
    <li> Notice: Joe is behind 1 percent from where he started
    </ul>
    </p> 
<li> True growth rate = mean - 1/2 variance
     <p>
     <ul>
     <li> Sometimes called the log-growth rate
     <li> Related to a utility function that looks like a log
     </ul>
     </p>
<li> To tame distribution of red, compute the log(final wealth)
     <p>
     <ul>
     <li> either use base 10 logs (to make the ploting easier) or base
     e logs (to make the drift rate meaningful) But make sure that
     everyone in class is useing the same base!
     <li> Have each group compute their three logs of final wealth
     <li> Sketch new histograms for each color (or compute logs in JMP)
     <li> red is much more spread out, but drifts left
     </ul>
     </p>
<li> Work out what should happen for Pink
     <p>
     <ul>
     <li> via example, show that the mean of pink is about 1/2 that of
     read (in other words, the mean of white is about zero) 
     <li> Via example, show that the standard deviation of Pink is
     about 1/2 that of Red (In other words, the variance of white is
     almost zero)
     <li> compute the expected log growth rate for pink (mean - 1/2 variance)
     <li> If using log-base-e, "guess" where a typical groups final pink wealth should be
     <li> collect pink data on log scale
     </ul>
     </p>
<li> Moral: Need both the mean and the variance to evaluate a stock /
bond / portfolio / option / derivative product.
</ul>
<h2>Some math</h2>
<ul>
  <li> long run growth rate = mean - variance / 2
  <li> Var((A + B)/2) = Var(A)/4 + Var(B)/4 + Cov(A,B)/2
  <li> If Cov is approximately zero,  Var((A + B)/2) = Var(A)/4 +
       Var(B)/4.
  <li> Optimum investment: How much market should you own?
       <ul>
	 <li> Suppose interested in long run growth rate
	 <li> Goal: maximize mean - 1/2 variance
	 <li> If we put w fraction of wealth in market
	      <ul>
		<li> mean is .07k
		<li> SD is (.22k)
		<li> Variance is (.22k)<sup>2</sup>
	      </ul>
	 <li> goal: maximize .07 k - .22<sup>2</sup>k<sup>2</sup>/2
	 <li> answer: take derivative
</ul>

<li> Next class we will discuss how to compute variances for combinations of stocks
